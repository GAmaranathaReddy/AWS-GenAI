For they burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do. Doctors who measured how much energy three couples expended during day-to-day activities found large differences between the amounts men and women used. No time to relax: Women burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do . All six ate a 600-calorie fry-up before each couple was assigned a different activity: an hour in the gym, three hours of cleaning, or lounging about. Their energy use was then assessed. Patrick and Roma Burn were lucky enough to spend the morning on the sofa. But while Patrick burned up 640 calories just by being a couch potato, Roma used only 292. The results are to be shown in a BBC1 programme, The Truth About Calories. Presenter Dr Chris van Tulleken said women tended to burn fewer calories at rest than men because they did not weigh as much and had less energy-hungry muscle mass. ‘Bigger people burn more calories than smaller ones,’ he said. But Patrick and Roma were extreme examples, he noted, as Mr Burn was ‘100kg of lean muscle’ and his wife ‘probably weighed half that’. A morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, the programme found . The programme also found a morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, which left the couple exhausted. Jim Norris got through 834 calories and his wife Elaine 729 during the morning, in which they spent an hour in the gym lifting weights. Meanwhile, Nick and Margaret Shenkin burnt 862 and 629 calories respectively cleaning the house. Dr van Tulleken said: ‘Moderate continuous activity uses more calories, and body size and lifestyle – what you do with your day – also play a much more important part than you might think when it comes to calorie consumption.’", "completion": "response:\n\nDoctors measured how much energy three couples expended day-to-day .\nDr Chris Van Tulleken said women burned less because they weighed less .\nResults shown in BBC1 programme, The Truth About Calories, on March 26 .\nThe Truth About Calories is on BBC1 on March 26."}

SAE's national chapter suspended the students, but University of Oklahoma President David Boren took it a step further, saying the university's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done. The news is shocking, but it's not the first time SAE has faced controversy. SAE was founded March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama, five years before the American Civil War, according to the fraternity website. When the war began, the group had fewer than 400 members, of which \"369 went to war for the Confederate States and seven for the Union Army,\" the website says. The fraternity now boasts more than 200,000 living alumni, along with about 15,000 undergraduates populating 219 chapters and 20 \"colonies\" seeking full membership at universities. SAE has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths, many blamed on the hazing of new recruits, SAE national President Bradley Cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity's website. The fraternity's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for \"health and safety incidents\" since 2010. At least 30 of the incidents involved hazing, and dozens more involved alcohol. However, the list is missing numerous incidents from recent months. Among them, according to various media outlets: Yale University banned the SAEs from campus activities last month after members allegedly tried to interfere with a sexual misconduct investigation connected to an initiation rite. Stanford University in December suspended SAE housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content. And Johns Hopkins University in November suspended the fraternity for underage drinking. \"The media has labeled us as the 'nation's deadliest fraternity,' \" Cohen said. In 2011, for example, a student died while being coerced into excessive alcohol consumption, according to a lawsuit. SAE's previous insurer dumped the fraternity. \"As a result, we are paying Lloyd's of London the highest insurance rates in the Greek-letter world,\" Cohen said. Universities have turned down SAE's attempts to open new chapters, and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents.", "completion": "response:\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon is being tossed out by the University of Oklahoma .\nIt's also run afoul of officials at Yale, Stanford and Johns Hopkins in recent months ."}

A four-storey townhouse in the exclusive London area now sells for £40million, while even a flat in the cheapest Monopoly area of Whitechapel has gone for nearly £5million. In light of such ludicrous prices, one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game – set in desirable English market towns. The new Mayfair is picturesque Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, where homes go for more than £872,000 on average. Petworth, in the South Downs National Park in West Sussex, is the second most exclusive town on the board, taking the place of Park Lane. Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road – both worth £60 and often seen as the game’s dud streets unless you can build a hotel on them – have been replaced by Morpeth and Wooler in Northumberland, where average houses sell for about £220,000. Upmarket estate agent Savills has also reinvented Bond Street, Regent Street and Oxford Street as Harpenden, Berkhamsted, and Bushey, all in Hertfordshire, where family homes routinely sell for more than £500,000.

Some 18,740 patients had to wait longer than six weeks to take cancer and other tests in January – more than five times higher than in May 2010 when the Coalition took over. The figures cover 15 of the most important NHS tests, including seven that detect cancers and others for heart disease. The number of NHS patients waiting longer than six weeks for crucial medical tests including Cancer has hit a record high . Just under 14,000 patients waited longer than six weeks for one of the key cancer tests. Some 2,954 patients waited too long for MRI scans, compared to 374 in May 2010, with a further 1,125 patients were forced to wait longer than they should for CT scans – up from 215 five years ago. Just under 2,904 patients in January waited too long for ultrasound tests - not including pregnant women – up from 291 in 2010. Four crucial endoscopy tests that detect bowel and stomach cancers have also seen a huge spike in patients waiting longer than six weeks. Some 6,978 patients in January waited too long for one of the tests – up from 976 in May 2010. A Labour Government will guarantee that NHS patients in England will wait no longer than one week for cancer tests and results by 2020. In 2014, 20,775 patients who were diagnosed with cancer waited for than 62 days to begin treatment. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the figures showed David Cameron had 'damaged the care that Cancer patients are receiving' Andy Burnham, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said the figures were 'damning evidence' of the Government's failure on NHS waiting lists. Mr Burnham said: 'He has presided over a major cut in the cancer budget in this Parliament and this has damaged the care that cancer patients are receiving. 'All the gains that Labour made have been lost and the NHS is heading in the wrong direction. Thousands of families are waiting too long for tests, facing all the anxiety that means, and cancer is being diagnosed at a later stage where treatment is less likely to be successful. 'That's why Labour will guarantee a maximum one-week wait for cancer tests. 'The NHS as we know it can't survive five more years of the Tories. Families struggling with cancer can't take the risk and, despite all the warnings, persisted with an NHS reorganisation that disrupted cancer services.'", "completion": "response:\n\n18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks to take NHS tests in January .\nThis is more than five times higher than May 2010 when Coalition took over .\nFigures cover 15 of most important tests, including seven detecting cancer ."}

On Twitter, \"GIF\" became a trending topic as some folks pushed back. \"Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics. Not Jraphics. #GIF #hardg,\" wrote Web designer Dan Cederholm. \"So instead of GIF, we've got to say JIF? YEAH RIGHT,\" chimed in October Jones, creator of the \"Texts From Dog\" Tumblr and book. \"And I suppose those animals with long necks are called 'JIRAFFES.'\" And, of course, the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way.

Animated GIFs were a staple of the early Internet. Remember The Dancing Baby? That's a GIF. They fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged. But in the past couple of years, the Web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again. Wilhite has argued for the soft-G pronunciation for years.

However, the move has raised eyebrows among the local clergy, who fear the sacrament is being abused on the smartphone app, which deletes pictures and messages seconds after receiving them. Despite @priestDavid claiming he wants to make confession easier, others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger, who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest. Available to hear your confession: Christian priests in San Antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @priestDavid . 'It's not confession. It's not what the sacrament is all about,' said local San Antonio priest, the Reverend Tony Vilano to News 4 in San Antonio. 'He's not a Catholic priest. The church teaches when you go to confession, you should go to a priest either behind a divider or face to face.' While it is not known what Christian denomination @priestDavid is, he claims the Snapchat confession is part of a college student's project he is helping with. He also told News 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23-years. The confessions will be heard for two weeks from March 2 to March 16. Unethical: Confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face-to-face . Traditional: This is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years . 'Doing it Snapchat, I mean, you can do Snapchat or through the internet and list everything you've done and there's no humility in there. There's no ownership of the sins you've committed,' said Rev. Vilano to News 4. Others are more damning of @priestDavid. Archdiocese of San Antonio Deacon Pat Rodgers vehemntly disagrees with using Snapchat for confessions. He said that in fact the man, if he is a priest, has gone rogue and that confessions must take place face-to-face. News 4 in San Antonio took to the street to ask the public their opinions. 'Ridiculous. Absurd. That's what the Catholic church is for. Internet is not reality. You want confession, go see a priest,' said Richard de Leon III to News 4. In a statement, the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas said: 'The Episcopal Diocese of West Texas recognizes there are various ways churches can reach out to people through social media.

We've literally been looking for him all season, and Rick's old friend Morgan -- going all the way back to the first episode -- made a return appearance, wielding a stick he used to kick walker, and human, butt when necessary. And it was definitely necessary once he was captured by two men wearing W's on their heads, who, we would later learn, wanted to turn Morgan into a walker in order to join a horde of walkers they controlled. 2. Daryl looks done for . It was Daryl who happened upon that horde, and he and Aaron were soon surrounded and forced into a car, with little chance of escape -- that is, until Morgan rescued them. We rarely believe what we hear when there are rumors that Daryl might die, but that was a close one. 3. Carol and her casserole . Melissa McBride continues to steal scenes left and right lately, and her threatening of Pete while lending him a casserole may be one of the best scenes in the series' history so far. 4. Glenn gets shot . We seriously thought Glenn was a goner after a vengeful Nicholas shot him, then left him for a large group of walkers to attack. Somehow, Glenn survived and attacked Nicholas, but stopped short of killing him. That's our Glenn, always doing the right thing when it comes down to it. 5. Rick's memorable walker encounter . Just when you thought you'd seen everything, Rick literally squeezed a walker's neck then discharged a round causing the walker to spray out blood -- a walker he presented to the residents of Alexandria, in a bid to lead them toward survival. Rick was then rudely interrupted by Pete, who slashed Reg's throat in a fit of anger. At that point, Deanna told Rick to off Pete, which he did. Phew!

Researchers at the University of Queensland's Brain Institute hope to be able to trial their new 'cheap and mobile' ultrasound device within two years on humans. The treatment attacks the neurotoxic amyloid plaques that cause memory loss and cognitive failure with ultrasound waves. Scroll down for video . Researchers at the University of Queensland's Brain Institute hope to be able to trial their new 'cheap and mobile' ultrasound device within two years on humans. Research director Professor Jürgen Götz hopes the new method will revolutionise Alzheimer's treatment by restoring memory for sufferers. Research director Professor Jürgen Götz hopes the new method will revolutionise Alzheimer's treatment by restoring memory for sufferers. 'We're extremely excited by this innovation of treating Alzheimer's without using drug therapeutics,' Professor Götz said, according to The Australian. 'The word 'breakthrough' is often misused, but in this case I think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach.' The mobile device could be used by patients in their own homes several times a year,eliminating the need for expensive drug treatment that costs up to $250,000, Prof Götz said. 'With an ageing population placing an increasing burden on the health system, an important factor is cost, and other potential drug treatments using antibodies will be expensive,' he said. The mobile device could be used by patients in their own homes several times a year,eliminating the need for expensive drug treatment that costs up to $250,000, Prof Götz said. 'In contrast, this method uses relatively inexpensive ultrasound and microbubble technology which is non-invasive and appears highly effective.' Almost two thirds of all dementia patients in Australia suffer from Alzheimer's, which accounts for almost 250,000 people. The total number of dementia cases in Australia is expected to rise to 900,000 by 2050.

Egypt is ready to ditch Cairo and build a shiny new capital  if the government has its way. Fed up with pollution, traffic gridlock, a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure, Egypt is teaming up with a developer in the United Arab Emirates to build a city in what could be one of the world's most ambitious infrastructure programs. The yet-to-be-named city will spread out over 150 square miles, or roughly the size of Denver, and could eventually be home to 7 million people, the developers and government announced Friday. The current capital of Cairo, while full of history and vibrant charm, is home to more than 18 million people, and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating. The government says the idea is to reduce congestion in Cairo, which is projected to double in population in the coming decades. An exact location was not announced, but the city is expected to be built east of Cairo. It will be closer to the Red Sea -- between two major highways -- the Suez and the Ain Sokhna roads. The ambitions are big. In addition to the new embassies and government buildings, it plans to have an international airport bigger than Heathrow, solar energy farms, 40,000 hotel rooms,  nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals --  all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads. But if the dream is big, the bill will be bigger. The total cost is estimated at U.S. $45 billion, Minister of Housing Mostafa Madbouly announced at an economic development conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The unveiling of the new capital was paired with a glitzy website with renderings showing a lush and technological urban scape of glass towers and pools. The plan is backed by a group that describes itself as \"a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships\" led by Emirati developer Mohamed Alabbar. Alabbar made his name as the founder of Dubai's Emaar Properties, primarily known for developing the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Egypt is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures.  Myanmar has only recently completed its move from crumbling Yangon to the new city of Naypyidaw. Nigeria moved to Abuja in the 1990's, and Brazil carved its capital Brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago. And then there was another crazy idea of building a capital on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators at the time. That city?

After the Lions declined to use the franchise tag on Suh to save $26.5m of cap space, the Dolphins look to have beaten Oakland, Jacksonville, Indianapolis and San Diego to the most coveted signature in this year’s free agency. Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million, six-year deal with around $60m guaranteed, ESPN report. With no state taxes in Florida, the deal dwarfs JJ Watt’s current six-year, $100m deal which the Texans’ defensive end penned last year. Ndamukong Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million with the Miami Dolphins with $60million guaranteed . Suh, the second pick of the 2010 draft, is a four time Pro-Bowler and three-time first team All-Pro and led the Lions with 8.5 sacks last season. At 28, Suh is in his prime and is a once-in-a decade type of player whom the Dolphins can build their franchise around. A fearsome pass rusher, he was the cornerstone of NFL’s best rushing defense and helped the Lions to the play-offs last year. He will join the likes of Cameron Wake and Oliver Vernon in an aggressive front four. In his five years in Detroit, Suh played 80 out of 82 games. He was suspended for both of those for stamping on Evan Dietrich-Smith of the Green Bay Packers in 2011. Veterans such as Cortland Finnegan (right) were among those released by the Dolphins to free up cap space . Following his exit, the focus for the Lions front office will be getting fellow defensive tackle Nick Fairley to stay. After declining his fifth-year option last year due to injury concerns, the 26-year-old is considered the second-best free agent defensive tackle. Should Suh depart, which appears likely, they will need a run-stuffer alongside him. The free-spending Dolphins had a roster clear-out which paved the way for Suh’s arrival. Veterans such as Brian Hartline, Brandon Gibson, Dannell Ellerbe and Cortland Finnegan were among those released to free up cap space.

'We’re trying to evaluate where everybody fits and how we best use them and, again, trying to put the best football team on the field. He’s part of that process,' Fox told the Chicago Tribune last month. Marshall was close to Jay Cutler - following him to Chicago from Denver via Miami - but raw quarterback Geno Smith could test his short fuse. ESPN broke news of the trade, which will also see the Jets give the Bears a fifth round draft pick. Marshall signed a four-year deal in Chicago last May, and had seven consecutive 1,000 yard seasons before falling short last year - largely due to missing the final three games with a shoulder complaint. Despite the numbers, Marshall is yet to appear in a play-off game. Perhaps that will change in New York.

The 21-year-old neuroscience student from the University of Westminster shortened his own best time for completing the conundrum to 2 minutes 10.47 seconds. He smashed his previous record of 2 minutes 18.65 seconds to retain the title for a fourth time during a competition at the University of Edinburgh. To tackle the riddle that has stumped avid-gamers for years, Oliver practices extensively to hone his memory skills. Scroll down for video . Oliver Frost shaved more than eight seconds off his own world record for solving a 4x4 Rubik's cube blindfolded . 'It always feels great to break a world record, especially if you've worked hard for it for as long as I have to develop my memory and methods,' he said. The University of Westminster student used to practice his skills every night . 'But ultimately the reason I compete is to meet up with some of my best friends, travel around the UK and even abroad and to keep my brain sharp. 'To get to my speed it did take quite a lot of practice. 'I used to practice for a few hours a day, until I got a bit older and started to focus on university and jobs.' The challenge was one of several World Cube Association events contested by participants from 14 countries. Oliver added: 'The techniques for memorizing something like a Rubik's Cube or even other things like packs of cards or numbers have stayed the same for thousands of years. 'Everyone is capable - it just requires a bit of patience.' The Rubik's cube was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in 1974. He created the puzzle because he wanted a working model to help explain three-dimensional geometry. It won Toy of the Year in the UK in both 1980 and 1981, despite the fact most people could not solve the riddle. Labour leader Ed Miliband is a fan of the toy and once boasted that he can do a Rubik's cube in 90 seconds.

Married couple Natalia Kills and Willy Moon, who both were on the judging panel of the show, slammed the 25-year-old contestant Joe Irvine, after his rendition of Michael Buble's \"Cry Me A River.\" But it wasn't how he sang that ticked them off. \"I'm disgusted at how much you've copied my husband, from the hair to the suit,\" said Kills, referring to Irvine's new makeover for the show. \"You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting...you make me sick,\" the British singer added. Her husband Willy Moon called him \"creepy\" and likened him to Norman Bates, the killer in the horror film, \"Psycho.\" Mediaworks, the owner of the New Zealand television channel TV3, which airs the show, has decided to sack the duo for their scathing remarks. \"Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,\" said Mark Weldon, Mediaworks chief executive. \"We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately,\" Weldon said in a statement on TV3's website. The couple's comments sparked outrage on Twitter. In just a day, 77,534 people signed a petition to kick the duo off the show. TV3 was quick to respond, saying that it does not condone \"bullying.\" Irvine, who handled the comments calmly on stage, tweeted a smiling photo and thanked his supporters. Kills and Moon did not directly respond to the accusations, but Kills tweeted, thanking her fans for understanding her \"passionate opinions.\" The native singer, Moon, who rose to fame after his song was featured in an Apple ad, was lambasted in the media earlier this week. He reportedly used abusive language at a woman in a bakery in Auckland over a parking space brawl. TV3 apologized on his behalf, saying he regretted the incident and his language, but Moon has distanced himself from the statement on social media. Thankfully, it isn't up to the judges whether or not Irvine makes it to the next round -- voters will decide his fate on Monday night's results show where fellow judges Stan Walker and All Saints singer Melanie Blatt will continue to appear. Two new judges will be announced before next week's show.

The 21-year-old's fortunes on the pitch have mirrored that of his team as neither have been able to reproduce the standards of last season, when a brilliant campaign saw the Toffees finish fifth after being in contention for the Champions League for a long period. Barkley has struggled to rediscover the form which made him such an integral part of the team's success but he is working hard to get back to his best. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley has admitted he has failed to replicate last season's performances . Barkley, pictured scoring against Newcastle, has netted just two goals so far this season . 'From my point of view I haven't done as well as I know I can, but things like this happen,' said the England international. 'You have to go through bad days to get to the great days you have in your career. 'Everything's a learning curve. We haven't been going through the best period at the moment but we're going to come through this and be really good at the end of it. 'I don't feel pressure.

Many observers appear to have pencilled him in for a deeper midfield role but he does not feel that will get the best out of him. 'I'm a striker,' he said.

However, this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard. Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.' In the video, Jorge can be seen holding his son, who is unnamed, and getting him ready for a day's surfing.

Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age.

Aswat, who is thought to be 40, was arrested in 2005 in Zambia and later flown to the UK. He fought extradition for several years and was held at Broadmoor Hospital before being sent to the US last October. In January the European Court of Human Rights dismissed a case he brought against the British Government arguing that his extradition rested on inadequate assurances from US officials about his treatment. His lawyers claimed that it had breached Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Everton have fallen way below expectations in recent months and have only won one Barclays Premier League fixture in 2015 but Martinez is hoping they will carry the momentum from this victory into Sunday’s crucial Goodison Park fixture against Newcastle. Everton boss Roberto Martinez hopes his side can kick on in the Premier League after beating Dynamo Kiev . Oleg Gusev (right) volleyed Kiev ahead on Thursday night with a neat near post finish from a corner . Steven Naismith equalised in the first half for Everton with a curled right-footed finish . Romelu Lukaku scored the winner with a penalty on 82 minutes to give Everton a first leg 2-1 to take to Kiev . ‘It has to be a turning point,’ said Martinez. ‘Our fans know that we have got an honest group of players. When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team. ‘We need to focus on the league now and get the flow we had in our second half performance. You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know that we have got a good side.’ Things looked difficult when Oleg Gusev opened the scoring for Kiev, who have now failed to win in England in 12 attempts, but they struggled to contain Lukaku, who scored his seventh Europa League goal of the campaign. He echoed Martinez’s sentiments in hoping for a domestic spin-off. ‘I'm very happy with the team performance,’ said Lukaku. ‘The team reacted well after first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top class players. It's up there with my best performances. Now we have to focus on the league as we are not doing too well. ‘Everyone up front was scared to have the ball and we put the defenders and the midfielders in danger, but after 20 minutes we improved. Now if we want to save the season we have to keep playing like this. We are favourites, but it will be difficult over there.’ Lukaku points to the heavens after converting his 82nd minute penalty to put Everton 2-1 ahead .", "completion": "response:\n\nEverton beat Dynamo Kiev 2-1 in their Europa League last 16 first leg tie .\nGoals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku gave Toffees victory .\nEverton host Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon ."}

The Portugal winger, who is on a season-long loan at his first club, took his Sporting goal tally to eight in 23 appearances since returning from Old Trafford. The result kept them third in the Primeira Liga and on course for Champions League qualification, though their chances of bridging the 12-point gap to leaders Benfica are slim. Nani celebrates his headed winning goal as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 on Monday night . They were made to work hard by bottom-of-the-table Penafiel, who fought back from two goals down to draw level after Sporting centre-half Tobias Figueiredo was sent off. Having come into the match off the back of a 3-0 loss to Porto, Sporting needed a positive start and goals from William and Islam Slimani had them two the good inside eight minutes. But Figueiredo's red card gave the visitors hope and they replied through veteran midfielder Bruno Braga in the 12th minute. The Manchester United loanee celebrated his 70th-minute winner with a trademark flip . And they levelled three minutes shy of half-time through Vitor Bruno. However, Sporting were still too strong and Nani's winner - a firm header from 12 yards following a right-wing cross - proved decisive. Frustrations ultimately boiled over for Penafiel, who are four points adrift at the bottom, as both Dani and Pedro Ribeiro were shown second yellow cards in the closing stages.", "completion": "response:\n\nNani scored 70th-minute winner as Sporting Lisbon beat Penafiel 3-2 .\nThe Man United loanee headed home a right-wing cross .\nBottom-of-the-table Penafiel fought back from two goals down to level .\nGoal takes Nani's tally during the loan to eight in 23 appearances .\nWATCH: Nani breaks down in tears after scoring stunner for Sporting .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Manchester United news ."}

The race had been in doubt due to questions over which circuit would host the race, which has been shared between Hockenheim and Nurburgring in recent seasons. Home favourite Nico Rosberg won the German Grand Prix for Mercedes last year . Officials from both circuits had voiced concern that time was running out to organise the race, which was scheduled to take place over the weekend of July 17-19. A short FIA statement said no agreement could be reached with Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder (CRH). 'The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the CRH and promoter did not reach agreement,' the statement said. The decision means the 2015 season will be shortened to 19 races, with a three-week break between the British Grand Prix on July 5 and the Hungarian Grand Prix on July 26. Hockenheim and Nurburgring have hosted the German Grand Prix for the past seven years . The German Grand Prix has alternated between Hockenheim and Nurburgring since 2007. However, in January, Ecclestone said this season's race would take place at Hockenheim for a second successive year, only for the venue to be listed as 'To Be Announced' when the calendar was unveiled earlier this year. Georg Seiler, the managing director of the Hockenheim circuit, told German newspaper Bild earlier this week that time had run out to organise the race. According to the report, Hockenheim's concerns included the sale of tickets, which had not yet begun. It also said that crowds had shrunk since the glory days of Michael Schumacher, despite the recent successes of German drivers Sebastian Vettel and Nico Rosberg - who won last year's German Grand Prix driving for Mercedes.", "completion": "response:\n\nGerman Grand Prix has alternated between Hockenheim and Nurburgring .\nThere had been doubts over which circuit would host the race this season .\nThe decision means the 2015 season will be shortened to 19 races ."}

It is believed the 6in long enamel and diamond decoration that fixed onto the bottom end of the naval hero's sword case was tossed into the water by thieves decades before. It was discovered in 1973 purely by chance by a police diver searching for a weapon used in a crime. Admiral Lord Nelson's sword scabbard (pictured) is set to sell at auction for up to £70,000 . The chape was from a scimitar sword presented to Nelson by the Sultan Selim III of the Turkish Empire to commemorate the British victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. It is decorated in diamonds with the star and crescent which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent granted to Nelson in 1799. The locket no longer exists as it was melted down years ago but the chape is now coming up for auction in London with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 to £70,000. The one-armed naval hero (illustrated) was famed for his victories at sea, mostly notably the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar . Michael Moorcroft, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The chape would have been a super-expensive item of the day. 'We can associate it with Nelson through the star and crescent at the centre of the decoration which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent conferred on Nelson in 1799 and as seen in a portrait of him in 1801. 'The sheer quality of workmanship that has gone into it is quite stunning. 'It is an object that is pretty fabulous.' Five years before its discovery, an ornate locket with an identical decoration that was used on the top part of Nelson's scabbard was found during dredging work of the River Wey in Surrey. The location wasn't far from the Thames at Windsor where the chape was found, nor from Nelson's palatial home at Merton. Both discoveries were featured on BBC's Blue Peter. Mr Moorcroft added: 'Both the locket and the chape were found at the bottom of rivers just five years and a few miles apart. The locket was found about 20 miles from Nelson's estate at Merton.

The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread, which they could then share with friends on social media. But  the words 'lesbian', 'Jewish' and 'orangutan' are all banned from being emblazoned on the pots, it has been discovered. A French marketing campaign by Nutella has backfired after banning the word 'lesbian' (file picture) The Nutella website says: 'Here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love.' But users realised that there is a long list of words banned, which bizarrely does not allow 'lesbian' but permits the word 'gay'. The word 'Christian' can also be written on the jars, but other religious terms such as 'Jewish' and 'Muslim' have been banned by Nutella, Pink News reported. The 'Say it with Nutella' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread . Health-related terms, presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity, have also been banned, including the words 'cancer' and 'diabetes'. The company, owned by Ferrero, has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil, the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans. This may explain why 'boycott' and 'orangutan' make the long list of banned words. Ferrero said in a statement: 'By giving customers the opportunity to personalise their Nutella jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand. 'Negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field. Similarly, terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities.' The news comes just a day after it emerged that Marks & Spencer had banned the words 'Christ' and 'Jesus Christ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers. The policy emerged earlier after a customer was stopped from buying a £35 bouquet for a funeral because she said in the gift message that it was from a family in 'Christ Church Teddington'. Lord Carey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, said: 'If Christ becomes an offensive word in a Christian land then all of us should be alarmed.'", "completion": "response:\n\nNutella bans the 'word' lesbian from jars as part of marketing campaign .\n'Say it with Nutella' let customers write message on chocolate spread pots .\nBut a string of terms were not allowed - including 'Jewish' and 'orangutan'\nHealth-related words such as 'cancer', 'diabetes' and 'obesity' outlawed ."}

Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement. A firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs cannot be obtained. \"Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state,\" said Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert. \"We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch,\" he said. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah.

Wenger earlier this month said that Arsenal had 'started early' in trying to persuade the forward to sign a new deal. But, moving to deny reports of a bust-up between himself and Wenger, Walcott only served to further muddy the waters by contradicting his boss. Theo Walcott (left) has denied Arsene Wenger's (right) claims that he has started contract talks . He tweeted: 'I don't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands & bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense.

Yet, on March 14, Wenger said: 'The first contacts have been established with the embassy. We will see how that (negotiations) progresses politically. 'Walcott was difficult to convince (in 2013) and that is why it took us much time. 'We have started very early with him, but it was slow progress - he is very quick on the pitch, but off the pitch not always.'

It appears that the barrage of criticism received over the BBC’s adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s gothic novel Jamaica Inn is to blame for creating the fear factor.

Turner, 31, told the Radio Times: ‘I didn’t see Jamaica Inn but the fuss about it spooked us all a lot. ‘We started shooting a few weeks later and I can tell you all the actors were aiming for ten out of ten on enunciation. 'I’m doing posh RP [received pronunciation] anyway, so it didn’t affect me directly but I was scared, yes.’ Turner takes the role of British soldier Ross Poldark, who returns from fighting in the American War of Independence to find his fiancée Elizabeth Chenoweth, believing him to be dead, is set to marry his cousin. BBC bosses are hoping for a return of Poldark mania. Poldark is based on the novels by Winston Graham.

Reggie Bush trains with the Lions ahead of their game with the Atlanta Falcons in London last year . The 2005 Heisman Trophy winner was drafted second overall in the 2006 draft by the Saints. His five seasons in New Orleans yielded 33 touchdowns in 60 games and a Super Bowl victory.

Zephany means \"hidden by the Lord,\" a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence. South African Police have been mostly quiet about the case. A police spokesman, Andre Traut, confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl's biological mother. Zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a Cape Town hospital in 1997. She is 17 and in her final year of school. In fact, according to local reports, that's how she crossed paths with her biological parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse. According to the South African Press Association, an independent news agency, students at their second daughter's school unknowingly solved the kidnapping. The second daughter, who was born four years after Zephany was kidnapped, started eighth grade at a Cape Town school this year, according to SAPA. Fellow students told her there was a girl in her final year of school who looked just like her, the news agency reported. The two girls became friends, according to SAPA, and eventually, Morne Nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter's new friend. He, too, was taken by the similarities and contacted the police, SAPA reported. A DNA test was done, and last week police arrested the 50-year-old woman who had raised Zephany. The woman made an initial appearance before a judge who ruled that she would remain behind bars at least until her next hearing. The shocking revelation has no easy conclusion. While Zephany's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her, for now, the girl is in the custody of the social services. The Nurses have been allowed to visit Zephany for short periods, South African media reported. And on Tuesday, Zephany herself released a statement, via the Centre for Child Law, which is representing her. \"I want to say thank you to all the people who supported me through this, for continuously praying and never giving up on looking for me,\" she said. \"Under the circumstances, I am doing fine.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nCeleste and Morne Nurse's baby was stolen from the hospital in 1997 .\n17 years later, their child has been found ."}

The security forces, backed by Shia militias, raised the Iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city Monday night, a security official with the forces in Tikrit told CNN. The gains, according to the official, came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city's streets. At least 26 militants were killed in the operation, the official said. Earlier Monday, Iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on Iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern Tikrit. The renewed push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes aimed at ISIS targets around the city. The goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in. Now security forces and fighters from Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit back from ISIS, say they're gaining ground. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they've failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and  located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi. This movement led Iraq's military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request help from the U.S.-led coalition, which conducted airstrikes around Tikrit last week. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Catherine E. Shoichet,  Ashley Fantz, Ben Wedeman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.", "completion": "response:\n\nA push to retake Tikrit stalled as ISIS repositioned its forces around the city .\nSpokesman: Iraq's leader requested help because coalition has \"advanced\" capabilities .\nLeaders of predominantly Shiite militia fighting in area had resisted such intervention ."}

But today another accessory won the day - the enormous new 'smart watch' festooning the Commander-in-Chief's wrist. Obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a Fitbit Surge device - as he walked around D.C. and met with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, and later lunched with congressmen on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . New accessory: Obama sported the watch at a meeting today with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland . Check it: Obama has recently said that he was considering getting a Fitbit, or its rival the Apple watch . Device: The Fitbit Surge, pictured above in publicity photos, monitors heart rate, sleep and even the location of those that wear it . The Fitbit surge is an advanced piece of wearable technology that constantly monitors the body of the person wearing it. It uses LED sensors to measure heart rate, and can function as a calorie counter and GPS device. It also tells the time. The Surge model is the largest and most sophisticated Fitbit model, and sells for around $250. Obama has previous expressed his interest in emergent 'wearable' technology. In a February interview with Re/code, he seemed torn between getting a Fitbit and an Apple watch. Testing it out: Obama . Suiting up: Obama was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed . He said: 'I don’t have a Fitbit yet, but I work out hard. Word is these Apple Watches might be a good companion for my workouts. So I’m gonna see, I’m gonna test it out.' The testing had evidently begun by Tuesday, when Obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements. Fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep, where it collects data while the subject is unconscious, and can wake them up with silent, vibrating alarms. One feature the President may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode. Fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the President is only allowed a Blackberry because of security concerns, which is incompatible with his new toy. Both the White House and Fitbit have yet to respond to requests for comment.", "completion": "response:\n\nPresident wore $250 body-monitoring device around Washington, D.C.\nWas spotted with the item speaking to Enda Kelly, Ireland's Prime Minister .\nIn February gave interview saying he was toying with buying on of them ."}

The South Korean triumphed by two strokes from teen prodigy Lydia Ko, who took Park's world No. 1 ranking last month -- at 17 the youngest player of either gender to reach the summit. Ko, born in Korea but raised in New Zealand, had to settle for second place at Sentosa in Singapore on Sunday -- International Women's Day -- after winning her previous two events. \"She played great all week,\" Ko said of her 26-year-old rival, who will stay second when the new rankings are released next week. \"No bogeys around here and on a course where you can hit a good shot and you can get bad luck.

An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of some 300 beaches. It also found a sharp rise in litter overall in parts of the UK. Rubbish on some beaches in the South West increased by 89 per cent in 2014 compared with the year before, the MCS found. An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of 300 of Britain's beaches . Popular holiday destinations in Cornwall were among the worst, including Porthpean, Porthtowan, Gwithian and Gunwalloe Fishing Cove. The MCS complained that wet wipes – which are being used to remove make-up, replace toilet paper and apply fake tan – do not disintegrate like toilet paper, which means they survive being flushed or thrown away. Earlier this year, Southern Water revealed more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in Kent. Research for United Utilities in the North West showed one in ten households have had blocked toilets and drains due to baby wipes and make-up wipes. Charlotte Coombes of the MCS said the wipes should be thrown in the bin, not down the toilet, adding: ‘Our sewerage systems weren’t built to cope with wet wipes … they typically contain plastic so once they reach the sea they last for a very long time. ‘They can cause blockages in our sewers, then everything else that has been flushed down the loo can either back up into people’s homes, or overflow into rivers and seas. ‘Overflows also happen during excessive rainfall, or if the plumbing hasn’t been connected up properly, meaning the wrong pipes are heading straight to the sea. That’s when we find sewage-related debris, including wet wipes, on the beach.’ Plastic bottles and aluminium cans made up 10 per cent of the litter found in the MCS clean-up in September. The charity called for the introduction of a refund of 10p-30p for containers that are returned for recycling. Volunteers also came across bizarre items including a plastic hand, a colostomy bag, a piping nozzle, and on one beach, nine pairs of shoes.

The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions.

It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' Cech said. 'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this.'

A lot of people tend to get upset when this happens. The one who doesn’t is Jimmy Greaves. If he wanted to go, as a guest of either Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur, his former clubs, he could have secured a ticket, no problem. The Football League would probably love to have him, too.

This can happen when you’re 75. Jimmy thinks of Wembley and, as much as the match — which he would enjoy — he imagines the queues of traffic on the North Circular, the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick-off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of Liverpool and Manchester City and then the rugby. Jim loves the rugby. Truth be told, if Ireland versus England captured his attention, he might even have delayed changing channels until it was over. He finds it strange that people are still interested in getting him to Wembley. We want our heroes to behave like besotted fans, but Jim’s interests were always broader. Greaves' interests were always broader than just football, and he should be left to enjoy his retirement . He liked playing, and was quite brilliant at it, but since retiring he’s as likely to be engrossed in a Test match as a cup final, and he hasn’t the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes. He doesn’t claim to be an expert on the modern game, having not been a part of it for so long, but feels no animosity towards the Premier League or its high-earning players. For a man whose problems with alcohol led him to a psychiatric unit shortly after retirement, the second act of Jim’s life has been a triumph. We should perhaps acknowledge this, rather than wonder why he isn’t constantly seeking attention or another lap of honour. We should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of Jimmy Greaves. Greaves doesn't claim to be an expert about the modern game, and didn't want to attend the League Cup fianl .", "completion": "response:\n\nSpurs and Chelsea legend Jimmy Greaves chose not to go to Wembley .\nGreaves said he would rather watch the rugby than his former clubs .\nThe ex-England striker should not have his decision challenged .\nAs a former great Greaves has the right to a quiet retirement ."}

Former Middlesbrough manager Tony Mowbray has been appointed as the new boss of Coventry City . The 51-year-old had been out of work since leaving Championship outfit Middlesbrough in October 2013 . Chief executive Steve Waggott said on the club's official website: 'We are absolutely delighted to welcome Tony Mowbray to Coventry City as our new manager. 'We've secured the services of a highly-rated, experienced candidate for the job and Tony is a manager who has enjoyed plenty of success at a higher level. 'He has experience in coming into a club in challenging times and steering them through to safety and, on top of that, has enjoyed promotion too. 'We were all very impressed with Tony during the interview process and it speaks volumes that the club are able to attract a manager of Tony's calibre. Mowbray replaces Steven Pressley who was sacked last month - with the club flirting with relegation . 'We wanted someone who could come in and hit the ground running because we have 14 important games left in this season and the number one priority is to preserve our League One status. 'We have agreed terms until the end of the season and then, immediately after the final ball is kicked, we can reassess and look at a longer term deal. It was just vital, at this stage, to get the right man in to help steer us through the current situation between now and the end of the season. 'We believe Tony is exactly the right man for Coventry City and everyone here, from supporters to staff, will get right behind him.' Pressley was sacked last week after the Sky Blues slipped into the Sky Bet League One relegation zone following a 2-2 draw at Sheffield United. Dominic Samuel (centre) was on target as Coventry defeated MK Dons 2-1 at home at the weekend . Caretakers Neil MacFarlane and Dave Hockaday took charge for Saturday' 2-1 win over MK Dons which guided them out of the bottom four. Coventry go to Barnsley on Tuesday sitting just a point above the relegation zone following just one win in their last eight games.

The dog's ears had been sliced off and it had also had a stab wound to his head. Cropping ears is sometimes a practice carried out by dog fighters, but it doesn't involve taking the full ear off, as was the case in the stray found last week. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

'It's heartbreaking that someone would do this,' Barrio Dog volunteer Ernie Zenteno told KHOU. 'Animal cruelty, that's what this is.' The volunteer took the dog, which has since been named Hotch, to the Gulfgate Animal Hospital where veterinarians worked to treat its wounds. Gulfgate's Dr Sherry Corona says Hotch's ear had become infected but the dog will make a full recovery.

Vettori has announced Sunday's match against either Australia or India will be the last of his international career. He will retire as New Zealand's most-capped Test player - with 113 matches - and one-day internationals - Sunday's match will be his 291st for New Zealand and he needs three more dismissals Sunday to finish with 300 ODI wickets. Brendon McCullum (left) celebrates with Daniel Vettori after New Zealand reached the World Cup final . Vettori made his debut aged 18 in 1997 and, now 36, has spent half his life in the New Zealand team. While he says retirement 'is not what I'm thinking about', his teammates want to help him end his career with a win. 'He's been an outstanding contributor for us,' McCullum said. 'He's played for New Zealand for half his life. '(A win) would be a great way to potentially send him off.' Vettori is still a key member of the New Zealand team and has demonstrated his value throughout the World Cup with a series of frugal bowling performances and cameo innings'.

'He was struggling a bit with his back, too. He's played a lot of his career with bumps and bruises and niggles and strains. He's a tough customer and he's been an amazing servant.' But Vettori doesn't want his swansong to distract New Zealand from its aim of winning the World Cup for the first time. 'It's not what I'm thinking about,' he said. 'It's just about having some fun and enjoying the game and enjoying the build-up to a World Cup final,' he said. 'No-one else in New Zealand cricket history has been able to experience that before so it's pretty exciting to experience a grand final week.

According to authorities, Phillip Poissonnier of Post Falls was given a ride home by police around 1am on Monday after being thrown out of Club Tequila when he was ten beers in. But instead of going to bed after getting dropped off, he reportedly made 12 emergency calls, the first wanting officers to come back to discuss his $30 bar tab.

But one in three Britons are regularly missing out on breakfast, a survey of 2,000 adults found. This can leave them tired and moody and lower the quality of their work, oat producer Flahavan's said. While two in three people are eating breakfast every day, the study found one in 13 never had a morning meal. Of those who are regularly missing out, two-thirds said they found it difficult to eat early in the morning, with other reasons including not considering breakfast important, not having time, preferring to stay in bed and having too many chores. The results showed more people were regularly missing the first meal of the day, compared with the 20 per cent who were skipping it three years ago. The time taken to eat the meal is also lower, now at just over nine minutes compared to almost ten in 2012. What the nation is eating for breakfast appears to be constantly changing, too. While cold cereals, porridge, fruit and toast remain the staple morning fuel for the majority of breakfasters, the fry up has now become an occasional treat with only 1.5 per cent of respondents saying they started the day with a traditional breakfast most days of the week. John Noonan, of Flahavan's, said: 'Our findings show a shift in the number of people having breakfast - the eating occasion renowned for being the most important meal of the day. Just 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast before work every morning, a study found . 'It's no secret that we all need a good breakfast to get the day off to a good start. 'And while it's great to see that people are becoming more health-conscious with their breakfast choices - opting for porridge and healthy cereals - the number of people who are regularly going without breakfast is certainly surprising, particularly given that making a nutritious, tasty breakfast takes no time at all. 'We know that people are time-pressured, particularly from Monday to Friday, but skipping breakfast only results in people feeling worse in the long-run, as they don't have enough energy to power them through the day.'", "completion": "response:\n\nOne in 13 people never eat breakfast, a study of 2,000 Britons found .\nA third of adults regularly skip the morning meal as they run out of time .\nThis can leave them tired and moody and can lower quality of their work .\nJust 1.5 per cent of people have a traditional fried breakfast every day ."}

With the NRL season due to begin again this week, the Sydney Morning Herald is reporting that officials have been switched out of pink for the coming campaign. Instead, the referees will wear blue or red, depending on the kits of the two teams involved in any game. NRL referees have ditched the idea of pink jerseys after claims they undermined official's authority . The new colours have been chosen as they apparently encourage discipline but the move has come in for criticism. Performance psychologist Chris Pomfret said it was purely a symbolic gesture which wouldn't change how the game was refereed. 'The colour of a uniform is irrelevant to the skill execution of referees, just the same as the colour of a jersey worn by players is irrelevant to their skill execution,' he said. 'In short, the colour of a uniform shouldn't matter as it doesn't directly impact on the performance of a referee, which ultimately has the most influence on their perceived credibility.' Officials will wear red or blue for the new season, which starts this, in a move that has been criticised . There was also a suggestion that the NRL risked alienating the gay community and breast cancer awareness campaigners. Dr Tom Heenean, from the Natonal Centre for Australian Studies, told the BBC it was a move away from 'social inclusion.' 'If you are wanting a more inclusive football community you have to be more aware of the symbolisms of marginal groups within that community,' he said.", "completion": "response:\n\nAustralian NRL officials had been wearing pink jerseys .\nBut Rugby League chiefs have decided to switch to blue or red .\nReferees had complained the pink shirts made it hard to enforce discipline ."}

The London-based human rights group said that a first bill, which has already been approved once by parliament, would restrict access to contraception, forcing women into unsafe backstreet abortions. It said the second draft law, which is to go before parliament next month, would close many jobs to women who choose not to or are unable to have children. Iran is seeking to double its population to 150 million by 2065 . 'The proposed laws will entrench discriminatory practices and set the rights of women and girls in Iran back by decades,' said Amnesty's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui. 'The authorities are promoting a dangerous culture in which women are stripped of key rights and viewed as baby-making machines rather than human beings with fundamental rights to make choices about their own bodies and lives.' The draft legislation comes in response to a call by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to double Iran's population to 150 million within 50 years. Iranian officials have expressed alarm at its ageing population, with an official at the national birth registry, Mohammad Nazemi Ardekani, warning last April the population growth rate could fall to zero 'within 30 years'. The bill, which is now undergoing amendment, would ban voluntary sterilisation and end state subsidies for contraceptive services. Draft legislation will put men and women in Iran who can have children to the top of the priority list for jobs . Amnesty said it would inevitably lead to an increase in backstreet terminations in a country where abortion is illegal except in very limited circumstances. The second bill would require both public and private employers to give priority to men and women with children when hiring for certain jobs. It would also make divorce more difficult and restrict intervention by the state in family disputes, which Amnesty said would expose women to increased risks of domestic violence. Women currently make up around 60 percent of university students in Iran and 10 percent of economically active women are employed, according to official figures.", "completion": "response:\n\nDraft legislation aimed at boosting a flagging birth rate  has come under fire .\nIran is seeking to double its population to 150million by 2065 .\nIt wants to restrict contraception access and prioritise jobs for the fertile .\nAmnesty says the laws will set rights of women back decades ."}

The 30-year-old had requested a personal hearing after being charged with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official in or around the tunnel area after the final whistle following Albion's 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa this month. Brunt is banned with immediate effect and will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester City. West Bromwich Albion midfielder has been handed a one match ban and an £8,000 fine by the FA . Brunt  argues with referee Anthony Taylor after he sends off Claudio Yacob during the game at Villa Park . The Northern Ireland international faced the threat of a two-game ban and Albion's director of football administration Richard Garlick believes the punishment reflected the circumstances in which the game finished. Villa fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle and had also run onto the surface while the game was still in play, with the invasions the subject of an FA investigation. Referee Anthony Taylor had also sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish towards the end of the match. Thousands streamed on to the pitch after the match, which helped make Brunt's an 'extraordinary case' 'We had a fair hearing and feel the punishment is an acknowledgement by the Commission that this was an extraordinary case,' said Garlick, after the Independent Regulatory Commission in London on Tuesday. 'It was a difficult end to the game for everyone and emotions were running high. 'I think Chris's disciplinary record, which has seen him issued with one red card in more than 400 appearances at the highest levels, was also rightly noted.'", "completion": "response:\n\nThe FA have handed a one match ban and £8,000 fine to Chris Brunt .\nWest Bromwich Albion midfielder was charged with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official .\nThe incident occurred in the aftermath of West Brom's FA Cup exit .\nBrunt misses Saturday's Premier League trip to face Manchester City ."}

The unnamed man, who is in his 60s, was one of thousands of Western men who visit Russia every year to find love. It is not known where or how he met his young wife, but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the EU without a visa. A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU (file picture) Because of these fears, he 'folded' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to Nice, in southern France. At Terespol station, on the border between Poland and Belarus, the woman was found by immigration officials, who immediately arrested the couple. After searching the suitcase, Polish customs spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'The Russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside.' There were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way, however it became clear that she was fine. Mr Sienicki added: 'She was in good shape and wasn't in need of any medical attention.' Despite this, the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls, which is a criminal offence. The newly-married couple were on their way back to Nice (pictured), France, when their bizarre ploy was rumbled . The wives of men with EU passports can  travel wherever they like in the EU, so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem. The Russian bride was said to be in her thirties and extremely supple, making it relatively easy for her to fit inside the suitcase. The couple had risked a three-year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control. Mr Sienicki said: 'This was the first time I've seen someone travel like this. She very well could have been a victim of human trafficking.'

The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.'

Emwazi told British newspaper The Guardian that the stories about the couple recognizing the voice were false. \"Lie, lie, lie,\" he reportedly said. Mohammed Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988 and moved to the United Kingdom with his parents and sister when he was six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for people suspected of involvement in terrorism. CAGE interacted with Emwazi before he joined the terror group, a member has said. CAGE released a recording last week that it said it taped of Mohammed Emwazi in 2009. In that recording, Emwazi is heard talking about been questioned by British intelligence service regarding a July 2005 terror attack in London. CNN's Samira Said, Roba Alhenawi and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.", "completion": "response:\n\nJassem Emwazi's attorney tells CNN he will sue people who say son is \"Jihadi John\"\nKuwaiti newspaper: Father of Mohammed Emwazi attacks \"false rumors\" about his son ."}

A convicted child molester begged a New York judge for permission to leave jail so that he could donate to a sperm bank and have a chance to procreate. Yova Kana Shaday, 69, said he was being robbed of his 'last opportunity to be fruitful and multiply' in the letter filed at Brooklyn Federal Court. Shaday said he feared that, if imprisoned, he would be too old to donate his sperm once released. He wrote that he prayed the court would consider the 'very serious truth in releasing me' and warned  that 'the gravity of this extenuating circumstance is in your hands'. The letter signs off with Shaday's hope that 'your god lead you to be fruitful and multiply,' before he adds in a 'P.S' that his sperm donation was intended for an unnamed 'specific receiver,' according to the New York Daily News. Federal Judge Edward Korman swiftly denied Shaday's request. Shaday is currently incarcerated at the Queens Correctional Facility. He is awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender in New York. If convicted, Shaday faces up to 10 years in prison. Police received a tip in November that Shaday was living under a fake name in Brooklyn, a fact they confirmed after showing his mugshot to neighbors. The request was filed to Brooklyn Federal Court (pictured) and was swiftly denied by Federal Judge Edward Korman. Shaday is currently awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender . They then nabbed Shaday when he reported his bicycle was missing to the NYPD under his alias, Lucas Avram. Shaday is supposed to register as a sex offender every year for the rest of his life, . According to court papers, Shaday has been convicted twice in California for molesting minors. Shaday pleaded guilty to committing a lewd act with a child under the age of 14 in 2005 and was sentenced to three years in prison. He then pleaded guilty to molesting a child under the age of 18 in 2008 and served 180 days in jail.", "completion": "response:\n\nYova Kana Shaday is currently incarcerated in Queens, New York and is awaiting trial for failing to register as a sex offender in the state .\nShaday said sperm donation was intended for unnamed 'specific receiver'\nFederal Judge Edward Korman swiftly denied his request .\nShaday was convicted in 2005 and 2008 for molesting minors in California ."}

The mummy was discovered, encased in a cavity in the statue, when a private buyer brought it to an expert for restoration. It's unclear when or how the statue was removed from China. But it wasn't until a team of researchers and scientists did a CT scan -- a comprehensive three dimensional x-ray image -- last year, did they discover the mummy's organs were missing. \"We thought it would be lung tissue, but instead we found little scraps of paper covered with Chinese characters,\" said Vincent van Vilsteren, an archaeology curator from Drents Museum. The mummy was found sitting on a bundle of cloth covered in Chinese inscriptions, revealing its identity as a Buddhist monk called Liuquan who may have practiced \"self-mummification\" to prepare for life after death. The process of self-mummification is a known tradition in countries like Japan, China and Thailand, and was practiced over a thousand years ago. The elaborate and arduous process includes eating a special diet and drinking a poisonous tea so the body would be too toxic to be eaten by maggots. The few monks that were able to successfully complete the process were highly revered. \"We suspect that for the first 200 years, the mummy was exposed and worshiped in a Buddhist temple in China... only in the 14th century did they do all the work to transform it into a nice statue,\" said van Vilsteren. Researchers are still waiting on DNA analysis results in hopes to trace the mummy back to its exact location in China.

Rich Mills, who freed her. \"She was literally pinned down. She could not get away even if she tried.\" Once freed, Mills rushed Cabela to Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center.

Now, scientists have confirmed there is truth in the old adage – at least when it comes to salaries. A study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues. Despite working just as hard, they are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked. Researchers at the University of Sheffield made the discovery while looking at the impact of personality traits on workers' productivity and pay. A University of Sheffield study claims friendly staff receive lower wages than their less agreeable colleagues . Their study found: 'More agreeable workers tend to earn less in the actual labour market, but their productivity is similar when measured in the laboratory setting.' They defined agreeableness as being compliant, modest, trustworthy and sympathetic. The study found women were most likely to show agreeable personality traits, perhaps one reason for the gender pay gap. Being agreeable made workers more successful in team work, but had three negative effects on their performance. Friendly staff are often reluctant to push for pay rises, too focused on team work and overly concerned about being liked, according to the study . 'First, helping others may reduce individual productivity,' the study found. 'Secondly, agreeable people may be less effective when bargaining their wage. Finally, agreeable individuals may enter less stable, lower paid occupations.' The study was presented at the Royal Economic Society's 2015 annual conference in Manchester yesterday by Ana Nuevo-Chiquero, of The University of Sheffield, who conducted the research alongside Australian and Spanish academics. They analysed the personalities and productivity levels of students at the University of New South Wales in laboratory conditions, and analysed a host of academic reports on personality and wages. It found that, while conscientious and emotionally stable workers earn more money, being too open could harm your career. While openness with colleagues indicated an artistic, curious and imaginative worker, it could make them less likely to obey the rules, which could cause problems at a formal workplace. Neuroticism, which researchers linked to mood swings and unpredictability, also impacted performance as these workers often lacked self-confidence and were insecure.", "completion": "response:\n\nStudy found friendly staff receive lower wages than unpleasant colleagues .\nThey are often reluctant to push for pay rise and too focused on team work .\nUniversity of Sheffield researchers looked at impact of personality traits ."}

The 77-year-old woman, named only as Mrs. Rosetta, from the northeastern town of Vicenza, made the drink after her grandchildren and their friend, aged between nine and 12, asked for it, making extra cups for her son, her husband and herself. Shortly afterwards, all of them were taken to hospital with stomach upsets and vomiting, which authorities traced to the sachets, which expired in 1990, according to Il Giornale Di Vicenza. The woman, named as Mrs Rosetta, 77, was taken to hospital with vomiting and a stomach upset along with her husband, son, two grandchildren, and their young friend . It is thought that Mrs Rosetta bought the drink some time in the late 80s, before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Tiananmen Square protests, and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister. The chocolate powder had then laid at the bottom of her cupboard, forgotten, until one day earlier this month when one of her grandchildren asked for it to drink. Discovering the sachets at the back of the cupboard, she promptly mixed it into warm milk and served it, with disastrous results. According to Il Mattino her husband began suffering from vomiting and a stomach upset around an hour after drinking the chocolate, followed by herself, the children, and finally her son. The pensioner, from the town of Vicenza, is thought to have bought the sachets some time in the late 80s - before the fall of the Berlin Wall and while Margaret Thatcher was still Prime Minister . All of them had to be rushed to the emergency room for treatment, with one of the youngsters being kept in for 20 days, reports Corriere Del Veneto. While it appears to have been an accident, the grandmother has been charged with causing injury, with a file passed to prosecutors for consideration. Hot chocolate mix usually contains powdered cocoa and sugar, which do not usually go off but will decrease in quality over time, and powdered milk, which can go off after long periods.

It may be unimaginable that you won’t be able to call friends ‘Gazza’ and ‘Babs’ in the future, but according to latest research these once popular names are no longer being used for the next generation. According to OurBabyNamer.com the name Gary reached peak popularity in 1952 in the US, coming in at number nine on the baby names popularity list where there were 38,000 registered Garys. However, in 2013, only 400 babies were thought good enough to be called Gary. Legendary actor Gary Cooper was the flag-bearer for his Christian name in the 1950s . In another name shocker, Nameberry.com revealed that Barbra, spelled in the same unique way as global superstar Streisand, was also out. Streisand made her unusually-spelled, condensed name famous in the 1960s, when it peaked at Number 511, only to drop off in the Top 1000 in 1971. To make matters worse the conventional spelling of Barbara, a Top 10 name for three decades, only just gets in the Top 1000. So no matter how you spell it the name seems a goner.

Other names compiled by baby naming website Nameberry.com that look on the way out are Llewellyn as a boy's name and Claudine for a girl. The popularity of the 2013 Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis obviously has not rubbed off on cinema-goers. A common name in Wales, with the distinctive Welsh double-l beginning, Llewellyn appeared on the US list for six decades. Bye bye Baby: The girl's name Claudine is another one that has gone out of fashion . But despite its rich Welsh history, literary cred and quirky nicknames, Llewelyn doesn't cut it any more. While Claudine, the feminisation of the ancient Roman name Claudius, ranked in the Top 1000 for first half of the 20th century, then rose to new heights in 1970 thanks to the popularity of singer Claudine Longet, only to fall off the charts in 1975.

Tallahassee Police encountered Brendon, 43, at a hotel \"in a state of confusion\" with toothpaste on his face, rips in his clothes and pants wet from an overflowing toilet he allegedly caused, according to a police report.

'I saw him come to a stop and relaxed, looking away. The next thing I knew I was looking at the sky.' In the YouTube video Mr Sant is seen going steadily along, minding his own business, in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well. However, after coming to a standstill because the cars in front have stopped, a car comes up behind the motorcyclist and crashes into the back of him.

Jin Hung's cruel castigation by neighbours caused outrage in China after pictures were shared on social media. Locals Yuan Kang, 35, and Cheng Yeh, 40, decided to mete out their own justice after accusing him of stealing food and money from the village, the People's Daily Online reports. Caged: Neighbours decided to lock up the nine-year-old themselves so he could learn his lesson . Shivering: Nine-year-old Jin Hung was stripped to his waist and forced to stand in a pond while locals shouted abuse at him for stealing . He was first locked in a cage so small he could not stand up and told to reflect on his crime. When this failed to make him cry, he was stripped down to his waist and made to stand in the pond while villagers hurled insults.

Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities.

'So in passing comment, word is around the place that there's been an incident and the police are involved. He's (Henry) not in a good situation, he's in the treatment room and he's suffered quite a nasty injury. 'Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don't go on a football pitch expecting to lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it's a football match and he's nearly lost his finger.'

Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for Dean Howell to score. But only after long consultation with his assistant did referee Dean Whitestone award the goal. Stevenage manager Graham Westley said that the alleged incident had become a 'police matter' In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal. Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club. Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup. The Barcelona forward was banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months and received a nine international match suspension.

The two projectiles were estimated to have flown about 490 kilometers (304 miles) before falling into the sea east of the peninsula, according to the South Korean official, who asked to remain anonymous citing government policy. Considering the speed, altitude and distance the missiles traveled, they are assumed to be Scud-Cs, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The missiles were fired as the United States and South Korea began annual military drills, which United States Forces Korea describes as \"nonprovocative training\" that are \"an important component of readiness\" for defending South Korea. The annual joint military exercises, called Foal Eagle and Key Reserve, have long sparked tension between North Korea, South Korea and the United States.

The auction house is offering an untitled work by Italian sculptor Maurizio Cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are English -- every defeat suffered by the England team between 1874 and 1998. Cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large (and it would have to be, wouldn't it?) piece of black granite, meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings. The artist says of his memorial stone-style work simply: \"I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.\" Known for his humorous and satirical art, Cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2-1 loss to Scotland in Glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2-1 setback against Romania at the 1998 World Cup. Since then, of course, he'd have had a fair few more to immortalize, including the two to Italy and Uruguay in Brazil last summer that were part of the worst-ever England display at a World Cup. The artist, whose other works include La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour), which depicts Pope John Paul II being struck down by a meteorite, first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in London in 1999. It's not known whether any England managers and players, past or present, came along to have a sneaky look. Current England boss Roy Hodgson is known to be a bit of an Italophile, but the former Inter Milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- Cattelan's work is on public exhibition at Sotheby's New Bond Street galleries until Tuesday 10 March.

North Korean officials could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident. Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin, a top official in Bangladesh's customs agency, told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th, after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight. Ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a North Korean diplomat would be carrying \"illegal items.\" \"It was very tough. We have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat,\" Ziauddin said, referring to the Vienna Convention, which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity. He said the suspect, whom he identified as Son Young Nam, the first secretary of North Korea's embassy in Dhaka, initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched. \"He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag,\" Ziauddin said. \"At first he said 'This is an electric motor.'  After further questioning he changed his mind and told us, 'These are cipher machines and very confidential.'\" Eventually, customs officers opened the diplomat's bag and found the undeclared goods, that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments. At current market prices, the gold would be valued at around $1 million. Entering Bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country's customs regulations. An official with Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador. It's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds. Due to international sanctions, North Korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems. \"It would be interesting to see if [the diplomat] is disciplined when he gets back\" to North Korea, said John Delury, associate professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies. \"That would be a way of saying whether or not he's a corrupt diplomat.\" According to the Foreign Secretary's office in Bangladesh, the North Korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country.

But only younger children at the Merseyside secondary were allowed to watch the once-in-a-generation event, with the rest of the school ordered to remain indoors. Hilbre High School, Wirral, had announced an eclipse-based science project with its younger pupils, who had spent the previous week making safety goggles so they could watch it, saying: ‘Key Stage 3 will be focused on the rare and spectacular event. Hilbre High School (pictured) in Wirral, Merseyside, organised an eclipse-based project with its younger pupils but told the rest of the school to stay indoors . 'It is great to see students engaging in real-life events.’ But the ban on older children watching the eclipse sparked a revolt, with an entire class skipping lessons so they would not miss out. Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions. Orders: The school (pictured logo) gave detentions for the class of 30 children that skipped lessons after warning about looking at the eclipse with the naked eye . Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’ The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye. Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’. The solar eclipse on Friday morning was the first this century and there won't be another one for 19 years .", "completion": "response:\n\nHilbre High School announced an eclipse-based project for younger pupils .\nRest of the school were ordered to remain indoors during the phenomenon .\nBut an entire class of older pupils skipped lessons to watch solar eclipse .\nThey were given immediate detentions after 'looking at it with naked eye'\nParents have complained children were punished for showing curiosity ."}

Hardened Volvo Ocean Race sailors must sleep in four-hour shifts, and survive on little more than freeze dried food and chocolate bars, if they hope to win the event. The prestigious competition kicked off from Alicante, Spain, in October last year, and will finish nine months later in Gothenberg, Sweden. Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing skipper Ian Walker, spoke about the journey so far. This is the 45-year-old Briton's third Volvo Ocean Race. \"As the leading offshore race -- and the one that is most vulnerable to nature and synonymous with danger -- it could be described as the 'Everest of sailing.'\" \"We trained for six months, covering 16,000 sea miles. As a team, we usually do three weeks on the boat, one week off. When not offshore, we train six-days-a-week in the gym.\" \"Everybody has four hours on deck, followed by four hours off when you eat and sleep. On the off-watch, you still have to get on deck and help for any sail changes, so it is quite disturbed.\" \"Mainly freeze dried food with some savory and sweet treats like beef jerky, dried fruits, one chocolate bar per day, and nuts.\" \"I'm the skipper, so overall in charge of safety and performance. I'm involved with all strategic decisions with my navigator, Simon Fisher, and I run one of the watches when on deck. Onshore, I'm also busy with media duties and management of our 15 shore team members.\" \"It can be an emotional roller coaster and it can be tough not to take things personally if they don't go well. At sea, emotions can range from frustration, boredom, elation, being scared, loneliness... it is important to try to keep a level head at all times -- especially if you are the skipper!\" \"I have great respect for the ocean. It will always win in the end so you must respect it. I am also saddened by all the man-made debris we see in the ocean as we sail round the world.\" \"A professional sailor with a fierce determination to win. Someone who is prepared to put the needs of the team above his own, and who is prepared to commit over 12 months of his life to being away from normal life.\" Photo Gallery: On board the 'Everest of Sailing' Insight: Can all-women team conquer sailing's 'toughest' race?

'You cannot rest players, you always have to play full strength, while opponents in Europe can sometime rest some players in their domestic leagues.

A £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child. The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin. The Queen - the baby's great-grandmother - approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19. Thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days.

Jimmy Barling said Monday that DNA tests will be done on tissue samples from the three bull calves and the one heifer calf to satisfy those who may question the births from one mother. 'We knew she was pregnant, but we didn't know she was going to do this,' the 76-year-old Barling said. 'This was a shock. This blew our minds.' Awesome foursome: Dora Rumsey-Barling is seen here among newborn calves Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo near DelKalb, Texas, on March 16. It is incredibly rare for a momma cow to birth four calves . Rare: The cow, described by Dora Rumsey-Barling as 'just a run of the mill red cow', had been bred to an Angus bull, so all four of the calves are black . This momma cow has apparently defied great odds and given birth to four calves. DNA tests will be done to satisfy those who question the veracity of the calves . Barling's wife, Dora Rumsey-Barling, owns the couple's 20 or so cattle outside of DeKalb, near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders. Rumsey-Barling's granddaughter named the four black calves Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo, Barling said. Local veterinarian Mike Baird called the March 16 births 'extremely rare.' He said the odds of four live births from one cow are 1 in 11.2 million. Baird knows the couple well and is nearly certain the four came from one mother, rather than a nearby cow perhaps birthing one or two and then moving along so that it appeared the four came from the Barling's cow. 'In the interest of science and the animal world, it's one of those things that need to be verified beyond a shadow of a doubt,' he said. Proud: Jimmy Barling shows off two of his new calves, after one of his cows apparently underwent an extremely rare pregnancy and birth . The couple watched the birth of the fourth calf after going to check on her when they saw buzzards circling above a field. Because the mother cow is unable to nurse all four calves, the couple are relying on neighbors to help. Moo has stayed with her mother, while Eeny, Meeny and Miny are with two different caretakers. Meeny is the smallest of the calves, weighing in at about 25 pounds. A typical healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds. Standing has also been difficult for some of the quadruplets.", "completion": "response:\n\nOdds of four live births apparently from one cow are 1 in 11.2 million .\nCow in DeKalb, Texas, had four calves on March 16 .\nMoo has stayed with her mother .\nEeny, Meeny and Miny are with two different caretakers .\nMeeny is the smallest, weighing 25 pounds ."}

The Irish trainer would have won it with Annie Power had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off Ruby Walsh but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate Glens Melody. That makes it seven wins running, Mullins having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record-breaker in Quevega before she retired to stud. Glens Melody capitalises on Annie Power's fall to win the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle . It will be a shame if Mullins’ total domination of day one overshadows the first Festival win of trainer Neil Mulholland courtesy of The Druids Nephew in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase. Mulholland, who runs The Young Master in this afternoon’s RSA Chase, is a trainer going places and now has the Grand National in his sights for The Druids Nephew, who won under Barry Geraghty. There was no redemption for last year’s unlucky Champion Hurdle third The New One, who could only manage fifth this time around. Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies was adamant that his mount was not himself, describing the feel he gave him as ‘not like him’. His father trainer Nigel will begin a retrieval mission next week but I wonder if Tuesday’s run means The New One will be over fences next season. Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies (above) was adamant that his mount The New One was not himself . Irish trainer Gordon Elliott is more established than Neil Mulholland but his efforts in plotting a route back to the Festival with his National Hunt Chase winner Cause of Causes also deserves praise.

The final race of day one now has the less than snappy name of the CHAPS Restaurant Barbados Novices’ Handicap Chase.

Patrick the wombat weighs in at an astonish 79lbs (36kg) despite the average for its species being somewhere between that figure and 32lbs (15kg). At 30 years old Patrick has also lived a lot longer than the expected age of a wombat. Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, said: ‘We believe he is the oldest common wombat in captivity. ‘To live that long is pretty good going. In the wild they probably only average 10 to 15 years. ‘But you know, he has got a happy home, good food and lots of cuddles so he is thriving.’ A resident at the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria, Australia, the wombat initially appears to be an average size when it first features in the video. Peek-a-boo! When Patrick the wombat first features in the video he appears to be an average size . But once it is picked up by its handler, the sheer size of the mammal is striking. However, according to Ms Leonard, the wombat is actually lighter than it used to be. ‘Well he was 40kg in his heyday. Of course, as you get older you lose a bit of weight so he is about 36kg now,' said Ms Leonard. According to Patrick's handler, Julia Leonard, in its 'heyday' the wombat weighed a whopping 40kg . Quite a handful! At 79lbs, Patrick is a lot heavier than the average wombat who weighs somewhere between that figure and 32lbs . Patrick has been in captivity nearly his entire life at the Ballarat Wildlife Park as – rather surprisingly – he couldn’t defend himself against other wombats in the wild. Hand-raised after being orphaned as a baby, the wombat is famous in the park for greeting visitors while being pushed around in a wheelbarrow – as seen in the video. With hundreds of thousands of fans, Patrick also has his own Facebook page and he was named the 3rd best 'city mascot' in the world back in 2014.

The seven-year-old female elephant was captured by forestry officials six weeks after it was spotted at a reserve in the western Ayeyarwaddy region. The elephants have been revered for centuries in Asian nations including Burma, Thailand and Laos, and their appearance is said to bring good fortune, as well as herald political change. Scroll down for video . A rare white elephant, similar to this animal, has been captured after it was discovered roaming wild in a jungle in Burma . 'We had to be careful,' said Burma's forestry department spokesman Tun Tun Oo, who said the elephant had first been sighted in the Pathein township. 'It's wild. We didn't want the elephant or the forestry department officials to get hurt.' Often pinkish in color, with fair eyelashes and toenails, the animals are actually albinos. They were normally kept and pampered by monarchs as a symbol of royal power and prosperity - and many people still believe they bring good luck to the country. The elephants have been revered for centuries in Asian nations including Burma, Thailand and Laos, and their appearance is said to bring good fortune, as well as herald political change . Previous white elephants transported from Myanmar's jungles have been heralded in lavish ceremonies in which military leaders sprinkle them with scented water laced with gold, silver and precious gems. And in the 16th century  Thailand, then known as Siam, and Burma even went to war over the disputed ownership of four white elephants. Burma currently has eight white elephants in captivity, most from the Ayeyarwaddy region. Five are in the zoo in the capital Naypyitaw, and three in Yangon. According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are between 25,600 and 32,750 Asian elephants remaining in the wild. Only males carry tusks and thus at risk from poachers who want them for their ivory. The capture of wild elephants for domestic use has become a threat to wild populations. India, Vietnam, and Burma have banned the capture of elephants in order to conserve wild herds, but in Burma elephants are still caught for the timber industry or the illegal wildlife trade, according to charity the WWF.

An amusing video shows the pigs leaving the beach and paddling through the crystal clear water as they make their way towards the boat. The pigs swim to the side of the vessel and jockey for the best position as the tourists squeal in excitement. The two pigs swim over to the tourist boat and begin treading water around it before begging for food . With the prospect of food and none as of yet being provided, the two animals becoming increasingly demanding as they tread the shallow water. They soon jump onto the edge of the boat, hang their trotters over the side of it and begin begging for food from those on board. Eventually the two pigs receive food from the people on the boat and continue to hang onto the side of it with their mouths wide open in anticipation. The video concludes with the two pigs – with satisfied appetites – returning to the beach. Jumping up onto the boat the two pigs hang their trotters over the side of it in search of a snack . There they are greeted by even more of their kind and collectively make their way over to another boat in the hope of receiving even more food. Discussing the encounter, the filmmaker wrote online: ‘They nearly turned our boat over.’ The video was taken on Big Major Cay – known locally as Pig Beach – on Exuma, a district of the Bahamas that consists of over 360 islands. Becoming more vocal, the two pigs hang off the side of the boat and demand that they be fed . Eventually the pigs' cries for food are answered and they are fed by a person on the boat . There are many theories as to how the pigs arrived at the island.

Despite being left in a coma after a car accident at the age of 17, Arthaud crossed the Atlantic for the first time when she was 19, going on to win a number of races including the 1997 Transpacific race that traverses the Pacific Ocean. The boat that she had sailed to win the Route du Rhum -- Pierre 1er -- also helped her establish a women's singlehanded west to east transatlantic record, as Arthaud notched a time of nine days 22 hours and five minutes. \"Her death has moved the French sailing world,\" added the French Sailing Federation. \"All our thoughts are with her family and her loved ones.\" Boxer Vastine, 28, and swimmer Camille Muffat, 25,  were also killed in the crash.

He’s six years older than me. He works on the farm and watches every game live, all the games are on in Argentina.’ Whether Javier, Maurizio and Sebastiano joined in with the Harry Kane ‘He’s one of our own’ chant is not known.

He is certain to be in the England squad when Roy Hodgson, who was at Loftus Road, picks his players for the clashes against Lithuania and Italy later this month. But another ‘one of their own’, Ryan Mason, would also have impressed Hodgson. ‘Is Mason close to a call-up?

Reacting to a howl, the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what Ramsey is trying to say. According to the Huffington Post, the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate’s dog food. There are several theories as to how dog-human communication has evolved over the years. Looking around the room, the puppy begins its high-pitched yapping while struggling to break free . Some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral, group-living wolves. While others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative. As for howling, dogs do this for a range of reasons including: locating other pack members, keeping strangers away, or calling the pack for hunting. The dog's owner Kayla Cagnola laughs hysterically while trying to interpret what puppy Ramsey is trying to say . Dog's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance. Whether these apply to Ramsey – who appears to just like making high-pitched noise – however remains to be seen. So far the original video has been viewed over three million times on YouTube.

The Arsenal boss, on the bench at Newcastle before the international break, is against Greg Dyke's proposals . 'So we can say one of two things - we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players.'

'I give you two examples, he said. 'In Yugoslavia in the past they decided you had to play three players on the team sheet who were under 21. What happened? They became professional subs.

Dyke's proposal to toughen up home-grown player rules has the backing of UEFA president Michel Platini, who hinted that he intends to follow suit.

The 23-year-old, who is addicted to drinking and sniffing gasoline, was first handed an ASBO banning him from large swathes of his home city following a bizarre drunken outburst during which he taunted unsuspecting women with sexual jibes.

The 60-year-old said: 'I saw the eagle swoop down and hit the water. 'It sat there for a few seconds and I knew it was trying to get something secured in its talons. 'Suddenly the eagle burst up out of the water with a freshly caught duckling. I think the unfortunate victim was a ruddy duck. 'The eagle flew off towards the nest with an evening meal for its babies. The eagle suddenly swoops down and hits the calm water after spotting its prey from the air . After sitting for a few seconds the eagle emerges with a tiny duckling grasped precariously in its talons . Photographer Phil Lanoue said: 'Suddenly the eagle burst up out of the water with a freshly caught duckling. I think the unfortunate victim was a ruddy duck' 'I just couldn't believe it when the eagle looked right back at the duck and stared into its eyes as the poor little guy was being carried away.' The bald eagle is the only eagle unique to North America. They generally eat dead or drying fish, mice, snakes, rabbits and frogs. The huge bird of prey hurries toward a nest, where the little duck will be used to feed hungry chicks .

The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single featuring Robin Thicke, Pharrell Williams, and T.I.

'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.' The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Williams had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap reported. The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage. 'This did not happen.

The club's dinner brings together Washington's media elite, with noteworthy politicians typically attending, as well. Despite being held by a media organization that raises scholarship funds for journalism students, the dinners are generally closed to cameras. Organizers only allowed a select few pool reporters to enter while the President spoke. The lack of media glare allows guests to let some of their guard down, perhaps unleashing a few more jokes than they might if the cameras were rolling. At one point Obama, clad in a white tie, predicted he would get more laughs this year than in the past. \"I'm not saying I'm any funnier. I'm saying weed is now legal in D.C.,\" he said. Voters in the District of Columbia legalized small amounts of marijuana last year, much to the chagrin of some in Congress. The President also touched on the controversy over the archiving of Clinton's emails while she was secretary of state. Obama lamented that while he was once a tech-savvy candidate, Clinton now seemed more up to speed. \"Now I'm yesterday's news, and Hillary has got a server in her house. I didn't even know you could have one of those in your house. I am so far behind. Did you know that? I would have gotten one,\" he joked.

But, after millennia in which the mummies have remained well preserved, those ancient remains are now in danger of rapid decomposition, Harvard scientists have warned. The culprit? According to the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in a news report published Monday, rising humidity that helps microbes flourish on the mummies' skin is to blame. As a result, scientists at the University of Tarapaca's archeological museum in Arica, northern Chile, have already seen some of its 120 prized examples of Chinchorro mummies start turning into a \"black ooze,\" it said.

Their findings will help conservationists in Arica -- an arid area where humidity levels have been increasing in recent years -- safeguard their precious relics. Egypt's mummies get CT scans . But Mitchell said he was concerned about potentially hundreds more mummies buried just below the sandy surface in the valleys of northern Chile. \"You have these bodies out there and you're asking the question: How do I stop them from decomposing? It's almost a forensic problem,\" he is quoted as saying. A \"complicated process\" was used to prepare the mummies, said Marcela Sepulveda, professor of archaeology at the University of Tarapaca, cited in the news release. It involved removing the brain and organs, replacing them with natural fiber and ash, stitching the body back up with reeds and covering the skin with a paste of manganese, ocher or brown mud, depending on the period. The Chinchorro people mummified human remains for more than 3,000 years. The oldest of the mummies date back some 2,000 years before the ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs.

Ukraine's president has called for a boycott of the 2018 tournament in protest at Russian military involvement with pro-Moscow separatists. Blatter responded by claiming the World Cup could actually help bring peace. FIFA president Sepp Blatter insists the 2018 World Cup will take place in Russia . He told a news conference in Zurich: 'What is 100 per cent is that the World Cup will take place in Russia in 2018, that's sure. 'A boycott of the World Cup or any sporting event has never brought any solutions to anybody. 'The European Parliamentary committee is asking for a boycott of the World Cup three or four months ago - it was a boycott of the World Cup in Qatar and now it is the World Cup in Russia. 'In my opinion the World Cup in Russia will be able to stabilise all that region in Europe.' Blatter said he had been buoyed by IOC president Thomas Bach and German FA president Wolfgang Niersbach coming out against a boycott. Asked whether FIFA should apologise for the chaos caused by playing the Qatar tournament in winter, Blatter added: 'This was a decision taken by executive committee of FIFA, they have a right to do it. If something happened the FIFA ExCo can change so we can also say play in winter.' FIFA has also moved to head off opposition from the clubs over playing the 2022 World Cup . FIFA has announced it made a profit of $338m (£227.2m) over the last four years and now has cash in the bank totalling $1.5bn (£1bn). Blatter said reserves that size are needed in case a World Cup, which generates almost all the money for FIFA, had to be moved or postponed. FIFA has also moved to head off opposition from the clubs over playing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar in the winter by trebling the amount clubs who release players will receive for the tournaments from $70m (£47.3m) in Brazil last year to $209m (£141.3m) for Russia and Qatar. Blatter, 79, is standing for a fifth term of president on May 29 and faces three rivals, but has so far not released a manifesto. Asked about that issue, he responded: 'I am not campaigning, I am doing my job as FIFA president and I will do that until last day of my mandate which was given to me in 2011. 'My manifesto is the work I have done in FIFA - I have now been 40 years in FIFA and 17 years as president of FIFA. This is my manifesto.'", "completion": "response:\n\nUkraine president has called for a boycott of the 2018 tournament .\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter insists the event will take place in Russia ."}

Mayweather continued to work on the pads in his Las Vegas gym . Mayweather also worked the heavy bag and tweeted that his training was 'easy work' 'My sparring partners gave me good work today. They were perfect for testing the strategy Freddie and I have developed to beat Floyd Mayweather. I was very happy with my stamina and speed today.'

Tom Brokaw has announced he will share the story about his battle with cancer in a new memoir titled A Lucky Life Interrupted. Brokaw, 75, drew upon a journal he began keeping in late 2013 after he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer in the bone marrow's white blood cells. The retired NBC anchor said he hopes the book will help others who have to deal 'with this unwelcome condition,' in a statement he released through publisher Random House. The book will be released May 12. Brokaw remained private through much of his cancer treatment, publicly announcing he had cancer only six months after he was diagnosed. During an interview with David Letterman, Brokaw said he was 'pleased with the progress' of his treatment but that's as far as he would go in describing his fight with the disease. 'There are a lot of other people out there...going through what I'm going through, and they don't have the advantages I do,' he told the talk show host, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Brokaw, who told Letterman his work was 'therapy', continued to work throughout his treatment, serving as a special NBC correspondent and contributing to the network's winter Olympics coverage in Sochi last year. In September Brokaw revealed on the Today Show that the cancer was almost gone, although he recognized that 'the disease will not completely go away' but can be 'managed'. Three months later Brokaw announced that he was officially in remission and that he would be going on a drug maintenance regimen 'to keep it there', he said in a note to his 'NBC family' that was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Brokaw served as the head anchor for NBC Nightly News for 23 years before he retired and passed the chair to Brian Williams in 2004. He remained mostly silent during the controversy surrounding Williams' story about his experience in the Iraq war and released a statement that said the anchor's fate was in both Williams and NBC's hands. Brokaw continues to serve as a special correspondent for NBC and has written seven other books.

Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, was among those killed in the attack at the the Makka Al Mukarama hotel in Mogadishu, the Somali government said. The attack began around 5 p.m. when a car bomb exploded at the hotel's entrance, according to witness Aden Hussein, who said he was meters away from the hotel when the blast happened. Gunmen then went inside the hotel, shooting people, Hussein said. One of the attackers, wearing a belt with explosives, blew himself up inside the hotel, police Capt. Ahmed Abdi said . A few hours after the assault began, state-run media reported that security forces stormed the building and killed the remaining assailants. The attackers killed at least six people, Abdi said. The hotel, which is along a highway leading to the country's presidential palace, is popular with lawmakers, journalists and business people. An Al-Shabaab spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, told CNN that the group was behind the attack. He said Al-Shabaab fighters were conducting an operation at the hotel against what he said were spies and government officials. Al-Shabaab has been active in Somalia for years. Initially its goal was implementing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, by warring against the Somali government. It has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in Somalia and beyond. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - a racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Mick Schumacher (pictured), 15, crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said.

Most other diving birds are able to simply fly on land - but not the penguin. Now, researchers hope to unravel the mystery of the waddle - and find out how it evolved . Watch the penguins on their custom catwalk . Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. Researchers set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it. The penguins walked over this to get their breakfast . Researchers also filmed the walk in slow motion, and are looking for the forces the birds excert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are. Scientists from the Royal Veterinary College and University of Texas at Austin have visited London Zoo to study the way the animals walk. Prof John Hutchison from the RVC said: 'The upright posture and waddling gait of penguins is not often seen in other birds. 'Most wing-propelled diving birds move using flight when they are not in the water.' Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the Humboldt penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. 'We're trying to understand the minute detail of how waddling works with living penguins, and then taking that back in time, looking at the fossil record of penguins to understand how evolving for such a specialised underwater lifestyle has affected their ability to move on land,' said Proffitt. 'We set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it. If they want to move quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain they may jump with both feet together. 'The penguins walked over this to get their breakfast . 'We were looking for the forces they exert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are.'

He was 71. Xu, who passed away at a hospital on Sunday, became one of the highest-profile figures in China's military to be caught up in President Xi Jinping's war on corruption last year, when the government launched an investigation into him on the back of bribery allegations. The court decided not to prosecute Xu due to his illness, but said his illegal income, including the bribes he was determined to have accepted would be handled in accordance with the law. Formerly a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, the body which runs the two-million strong PLA, Xu was also expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and had his rank of general revoked, according to a statement from the state-run Xinhua news agency. A seven-month investigation, which began in March last year, found that Xu took advantage of his position to assist the promotion of other people. He confessed to accepting bribes personally and through his family. He was also found to have sought profits for others in exchange for bribes taken through his family members. The amount he received was \"extremely huge,\" the statement added. In Chinese President Xi Jinping's annual New Year speech, he reiterated China's \"zero-tolerance\" stance towards corruption, vowing to keep \"waving high the sword against corruption\" and \"fastening the cage of regulations.\" 2014 saw Xi take down two top officials in China's fight against corruption, in addition to Xu. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang, likely soon to become the most senior Chinese official ever to face corruption charges, and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao.

Officers may be better employed tackling current threats than historic crimes and failings, Britain’s top policeman suggested last night. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for a ‘grown up conversation’ about the commitment to investigating decades-old issues. The Scotland Yard boss said he will ‘never shrink’ from the task of bringing a ‘bad person to justice, whoever they are, without fear or favour’. But he added: ‘We have to be better at weighing up the likelihood of success against the risks that those resources might be able to prevent or mitigate in the present day.’ Sir Bernard was speaking in London as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work investigating failings by institutions to protect children. The four-person panel will have statutory powers to compel witnesses and victims will also be able to appear as witnesses. There are concerns that forces are struggling to balance a tidal wave of historic allegations with the danger of present-day criminals. Hundreds of victims came forward in a phenomenon dubbed the ‘Savile-effect’ after the DJ and entertainer was exposed as a predatory paedophile after his death. In his speech, Sir Bernard also said Britain needs fewer pubs and bars in order to tackle the violence linked to binge-drinking culture. He advocated merging many constabularies to create nine super-forces in a bid to cut costs and bureaucracy. Sir Bernard said police need to be more open about how they manage the risks they face, including the £50 million spent on 42,000 missing children every year. And he said the people should protect themselves from crime in the same way people take steps to ensure they remain in good health. ‘I believe that keeping the public safe should be just as high priority as keeping them healthy, he said. ‘I’d like it to achieve the same high profile that prevention has in health over the last 20 years.’ Investigation: Sir Bernard was speaking as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work.

The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. \"They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,\" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. \"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,\" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. \"I only got information of the attack on my village last night,\" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba \"lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nYoung victims in the village of Njaba, ages 13 to 19 were singled out for killing, witness says .\n\"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee,\" witness says ."}

Despite his quarantine, Sam-Sumana is set to become acting president later Sunday when President Ernest Bai Koroma leaves Sierra Leone to attend a EU conference on Ebola in Belgium. The Vice President will carry out his duties as president from his home, the government has said. Sam-Sumana is the highest ranking African official to be in quarantine in this Ebola outbreak, which is fast approaching a death toll of 10,000. Sam-Sumana voluntarily decided to quarantine himself for 21 days following the death from Ebola last Tuesday of one of his security personnel, according to the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation. Sam-Sumana called on all those who have been in contact with the dead man to also put themselves in quarantine, said the report. 'The Vice President opted to quarantine himself because he wants to lead by example,' Sierra Leone's Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Theo Nicol said. Sam-Sumana's dramatic quarantine comes as Sierra Leone is experiencing a rise in new Ebola cases which prompted President Ernest Bai Koroma to reinstate restrictions on Saturday.

Bidding to win their first ever knockout match at a World Cup, the Proteas bowlers removed both openers inside the first five overs and never eased up the pressure thereafter. Duminy (3-29) dismissed Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews (19) with the final ball of the 33rd over and returned to send back Nuwan Kulasekara (1) and ODI debutant Tharindu Kaushal (0) with the first two deliveries of the 35th. The ninth World Cup hat-trick left the 1996 champions reeling at 116-8 after the loss four wickets for just two runs in three overs and when Kumar Sangakkara was dismissed soon afterwards, the writing was on the wall. Sangakkara, who had been looking for a fifth successive century, scored a measured 45 from 95 balls but was forced to throw off the shackles as the wickets tumbled around him and holed out to deep third man off paceman Morne Morkel. A heavy shower appeared out of the blue as if to mourn what looks like being the final one-day innings of one of the game's great batsmen and the players came off the pitch for a 23-minute rain break. It only delayed the inevitable, however, and Lasith Malinga (3) was the last man to depart, hammering the ball to David Miller at cover off South Africa's other main spin threat Imran Tahir. Tahir took 4-26, including the wicket of Mahela Jayawardene to leave another retiring Sri Lanka batting great with a tally of four runs in his final innings in the 50-over format.

A French policewoman is among the four taken into custody, French national police said. The policewoman worked at the Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois, northeast of Paris, the spokesman said. According to Le Figaro newspaper, the Fort de Rosny-sous-Bois is the location of an important intelligence center. Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store before police shot and killed him. His attack followed one on the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. France has been under a heightened state of alert since January's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, authors of the deadly attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices, were killed days later after two violent standoffs. The brothers were accused of killing 12 people in a massacre at the magazine offices. Coulibaly, suspected in the slaying of a police officer, was killed by security forces after he shot and killed four hostages during the siege at the kosher market. Charlie Hebdo has a controversial history of depicting the Prophet Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world.

The 35-year-old suspect, who was described as an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh, died from severe injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, a police official in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. \"There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,\" Doungal said, referring to the mobs involved in the incident. The suspect was accused of raping a local  woman last month. Since the attack,  tensions have grown between the native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district, police said. Thousands of protesters demanding cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex  Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack,  according to authorities. \"We retrieved his body before it could be hung,\" Doungal said.

Beckham is currently out in United States discussing plans for his proposed MLS franchise, while Nadal is in preparing to play in the Miami Open with the first round getting underway on Thursday. David Beckham (left) and Rafael Nadal posed for a photo with singer Thalia at the birthday event . The sporting superstars were out celebrating fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger's (left) birthday in Miami . The ex-England captain revealed plans to launch a new $25 million MLS franchise after exercising an option tied into the lucrative contract he signed after making a potentially risky move from Madrid to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. But the development of a new stadium has hit a snag, with an adequate location yet to be approved; team management, name and kit colours have also yet to be finalised by Beckham and his fellow investors. In March, a Beckham source told The Guardian: ‘Things are progressing in Miami, and we are very much on track in our plans. The Spaniard is in the USA to play in the Miami Open and is expected to be fit despite rolling his ankle . ‘David Beckham is very positive about the future of the club and he continues to enjoy incredible support from the people in Miami. ‘Right now, our focus is on identifying the location for a purpose-built stadium that will be the team’s permanent home.’ Nadal had an injury scare during a hitting session with Grigor Dimitrov on Monday morning. After appearing to role his ankle, the No 2 seed limped off before being seen moving a lot more freely as he returned to his car - much to the relief of the competition organisers. Nadal looked in good spirits despite suffering an injury scare earlier in the week during a training session .", "completion": "response:\n\nDavid Beckham was pictured with Rafael Nadal while out in Miami .\nThe duo were celebrating fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger's birthday .\nBeckham is still in discussions about his proposed MLS franchise .\nNadal is set to play in the Miami Open despite an injury scare ."}

The attack happened at a resort on Egypt's Red Sea, and police have revealed it is the first fatal shark attack in the region since 2010. The 52-year-old man's body has been moved to a local hospital after the attack yesterday. Scroll down for video . A shark attacked and killed a 52-year-old German tourist off Al-Qusayr in Egypt (library photo) Officials are conducting an investigation into the attack, which saw the man's leg bitten off at the knee. State news agency Al-Ahram report that the tourist was swimming with his wife when the attack happened. An official from the German Embassy in Cairo says they received reports that a German citizen died in the area but are not aware of the cause of death. It was the first fatal shark attack in Egypt since a string of maulings in 2010 that left a German woman dead and three Russian tourists wounded in another Red Sea resort. The attack happened just off Al-Qusayr, at a popular spot for tourists swimming . The shark attack is the first reported incident in five years, since one German woman was killed back in 2010 . In 2010, the German pensioner was mauled to death as she snorkelled in relatively shallow waters around the resort, which is famed for its scuba diving sites. She died just a day after Egyptian authorities lifted a 48-hour ban prompted by four other savage shark attacks. One victim lost a hand and another lost a leg. The Red Sea is home to several species of shark, but the type believed to have been behind the 2010 attacks was the oceanic whitetip common to the region. A red flag serving as a warning of shark sightings will be fluttering over Red Sea resorts following the death . The attacks in 2010 forced the government to close off a stretch of beach in the Sharm el-Sheikh resort for a week. In 2009, a shark killed a French woman off another resort close to where the German tourist was attacked on Sunday.", "completion": "response:\n\nGerman man, 52, had his leg bitten off at the knee at Red Sea resort .\nFirst report of death by shark since German woman killed in 2010 .\nEgyptian officials confirm death but say they are 'unaware of the cause'"}

We've been known to get that much in one day.\" In 18 hours, actually. It's not an official record yet, but it looks like the Italian village got 100.8 inches (256 centimeters) on Thursday, setting the all-time mark for most snow in 24 hours. Pescocostanzo, about 21 miles (34.6 kilometers) away, only got 94.5 inches (240 cm). That's more than Boston got in January and February combined, but just short of the 105.7 inches the city totaled so far for the whole season. One of the photos posted on MeteoWeb, the Italian weather website that reported the immense snowfall, showed a resident standing on top of the accumulation shaking hands with a neighbor. She is in a second-story window. The town, which has about 1,000 residents and sits at an altitude of 4,662 feet (1,421 meters), is prone to heavy one-day snowfalls, MeteoWeb reported.

According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 Assyrians captured on February 23 during an attack on villages in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander. The reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear. It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. When the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released, Graeme Wood, with The Atlantic, said he was pleased to hear about it, but not entirely surprised. \"ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,\" he told CNN. \"They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law.\" Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

But the bubble may be bursting, with many put off by ever larger ships, having to fly abroad to the first port, and cost. Others may be deterred by health scares such as food poisoning or ebola. The CLIA said it was the first fall in a decade with a major factor being a lack of holidays starting in Britain or Europe meaning travellers had to fly further to pick up their cruise. That may change this year with the launch of several routes from ports like Southampton, including the massive liner Britannia christened by The Queen last week. The fall also means Britain loses its places as Europe's biggest cruisers, overtaken by the 1.77 million Germans who took a seabound voyage last year.

U.S. calls to Cuba have typically been put through by companies in other countries like Italy and Spain. But now an agreement has been signed  that allows Americans and Cubans to make direct phone calls. Etecsa, Cuban's state telecommunications company, said the change would make calls easier and more affordable. President Barack Obama, pictured at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba. A direct telephone line between the two countries has been re-established for the first time in 15 years . 'It contributes to providing better infrastructure and better communications quality between the people and our two countries,' it said. The move marks a historic shift in U.S policy, which aims to bring an end to half a century of Cold War tensions. The lines were originally cut after American phone companies refused to pay a 10 per cent tax on calls between the two countries. But President Barack Obama declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba in December, announcing the re-establishment of diplomatic relations as well as economic and travel ties with the communist island. At the time he said: 'Isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach. 'We will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests.' Around two million Cuban-Americans are thought to live in the U.S. and many families rely on phone calls to stay in touch. Bill Pereira, CEO of Etecsa, said: 'We hope that this is the beginning of something, of a relationship that will allow us to build and grow and facilitate and ease communication between family members and loved ones.' Havana residents use public phones to make calls in December 2000. The Cuban government cut off direct telephone service from the United States to Cuba, although Cubans could still call the U.S. Residents are hoping that the step forward will lead to other services becoming available. Less than a quarter of Cubans, whose average wage is $20 per month, currently have any type of internet service. Virtually all home connections remain illegal and getting online at government centres is very expensive, as they charge between $2.50 and $4.50 an hour.

Putin had blocked the extradition of Lugovoy, a former secret-service operative who is now an MP with the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party. The Russian president also gave the Order of Honour to Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Chechnya. The award came as Kadyrov admitted knowing the man who has confessed to killing Putin critic Boris Nemtsov in Moscow. Kadyrov appeared to defend the suspect Zaur Dadayev by calling him a 'true patriot' and a 'deeply religious man'. Opposition politician Ilya Yashin said Putin was sending a signal: 'These are my people, do not touch them.' Kadyrov received his state award for 'work achievements, strenuous social activities and long conscientious service', but it comes amid claims that even some senior Russian officials are worried about the sway held by the Chechen. Lugovoy holds the post of deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's security and anti-corruption committee. He is chief suspect in the murder of former secret agent Mr Litvinenko, who from his death bed accused Putin of ordering his killing. Putin revealed yesterday that he held an all-night conclave of his defence and secret services cardinals ahead of his order last year to restore Crimea to Russia.

Although Andy Murray immediately expressed a desire to play the July tie on a grass court, the fact that neither Wimbledon nor the Queen’s Club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the Emirates Arena. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over John Isner on Sunday . Great Britain supporters would relish supporting Murray and Co in Glasgow again in July . All three day's of Davis Cup action at the Emirates Arena were sold out in a matter of minutes . The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere. The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass. While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface – while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue .

Unfortunately, because it takes about a week to set up the court, a Bette Midler concert would rule out taking the quarter-final to The Hydro, the city’s biggest indoor venue. But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards. Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: ‘The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world’s top sporting cities.

Peasant farmer Yu Zhilin and his son Yu Lingyun use pieces of scrap metal they have collected from disused cars in Hengyang in China to construct huge robots, similar to the characters of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee who appeared in the multi-million pound films. They have just sold an army of the metal robots for almost one million RMB (£110,0000) constructed in their own makeshift workshop. Xhilin decided to start building the huge models in 2007 when he realised how valuable they could be in China - where the latest Transformers instalment, Age of Extinction, was the highest grossing film ever in the country. The film targeted Chinese audiences, with Chinese car brands  featured throughout  and Hong Kong used as the backdrop for some of the action sequences. The pair join a cult of Chinese people who have started making replicas of the metal robots that have earned such notoriety in the country. Last year a team of farmers in Xiaoye, a village in the eastern Shandong province, began making the models at a cost of around $16,000 (£11,000) and selling them to property developers who have installed them in shopping malls in China. Yu Linguin has been helping his father Pu Zhilin (right) produce models of Transformers, using scrap metals from cars they have collected .

An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has been dishonorably discharged and sentenced to two years in prison for organizing a prostitution ring at an army base. Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country. As his court-martial was about to open earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts that included charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution. One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100. Two soldiers testified last year that McQueen recruited them and other cash-strapped female soldiers to join the prostitution ring. A military judge sentenced him to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge while leading a sexual abuse prevention program at the sprawling Central Texas post. However, he pleaded not guilty to sexual assault. One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. But prosecutors told Judge Lieutenant Colonel Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex. The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account. She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients. Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery. Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014. Fort Hood officials haven't indicated whether anyone involved in the conspiracy actually had sex, according to the San Antonio Express-News. In addition to trying to recruit the young female soldiers, McQueen admitted trying to get two higher ranking officers to agree to have sex with junior female officers.

'We have got a group that is not really suited for a relegation battle. The old-fashioned way is to battle but we have to play as if we are not in a relegation battle and pass the ball and move. 'If we go down we go down fighting.' Cleverley will hope to keep his place in the side when Villa meet Albion again in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday.

David Denton believes Scotland can bounce back from a nightmare Six Nations by winning the World Cup . Scotland have been drawn in Pool B alongside South Africa, Samoa, Japan and the US. They kick-off their World Cup bid on September 23 against the Japanese in Gloucester. Asked if he still believed the side would look to challenge the best nations in the world for the trophy, he replied: 'Yes'. Pushed further on that statement, he added: 'I understand it's hard to see. Our first goal is to get out of the pool and then give ourselves every chance of winning the World Cup. 'We never change [our views on what we can achieve]. We are in this sport to win. There is no doubt about that. There is a process to getting there - we need to get out of our pool first.

Scotland ended their campaign with another hard-luck story as Ireland steamrollered their way to a thrilling title triumph with a 40-10 win. And Denton admits it was not the way he saw the championships going. Scotland lost all five of their Six Nations matches in 2015 to finish at the bottom of the table . 'Today was a disappointing end to a disappointing campaign,' he said. 'We came in to this competition with a lot of ambition and the prospect of winning the trophy. We came in thinking we were a good enough team to do that. 'But a few of the results didn't go our way and today we weren't good enough. 'There are a lot of things we can improve on and we will do. 'Was it realistic to think we can win the title? One hundred per cent. There was no ambiguity about. (Coach) Vern (Cotter) said it at the start and we all believed it.

A huntsman in Ireland found that out the hard way when he was thrown from a horse making an unscheduled detour through a canal. In the clip a group of men can be seen riding horseback alongside a canal near Lockside Farm and Stables in County Longford. Two riders approach an upturned boat and jump over it without a problem, but as the third rides towards it the horse puts on its brakes and veers left off of the path and into the canal. Trotting through the water the horse falls, sending its rider flying, and after re-emerging swims off back towards the bank. Meanwhile, people on the opposite bank – along with a couple of very excited dogs – greet the sopping man as he clambers his way out of the canal. Easy as jumping a boat: A member of the Longford Harriers shows how it is done as his horse leaps over the obstacle . Applying the brakes: The horse decides that it doesn't want to jump over the boat like the previous two horses . The hunt, which generally attracts around 70 to 80 people of all ages, is an event undertaken by the Longford Harriers – the group featured in the clip. The master horsemen and women, who wear green to stand out, manage the hunt by controlling the hounds with a bugle. Riding across farms, lanes and roadways, the horsemen and women do not hunt foxes but instead jump over a number of high hedges, drains, stone walls and gates for fun. Splash!

An increase in television money for UEFA will also see prize money for the Champions League go up but the disparity with the Europa League will not be so great from 2015-18. At the moment, clubs in the Champions League earn an average of four and half times as much as those playing in the Europa League, but in the future UEFA will fix the ratio at 3.3 to one. Solidarity payments to those clubs who fail to qualify for the group stages will also rise significantly. Real Madrid's financial reward for retaining the Champions League would be even bigger than last year . Chelsea's Champions League exit at the hands of PSG has cost them a share of more lucrative prize money . The prize money for the winner of the Champions League final will rise from 10.5m euros (£7.6m) to 15million euros (£10.9m), and the winner of the competition could earn a maximum of 54.5m euros (£39.6m) in prize money plus TV cash from their share of the market pool. The move comes following a new agreement with the European Clubs' Association (ECA), which is also to have two representatives co-opted onto UEFA's executive committee - one of whom is expected to be ECA president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Sevilla won the Europa League last season, and Europe's second-tier club competition is getting a cash boost . The likes of Tottenham will benefit from the extra Europa League cash, if they do not finish in the top four .

The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. \"Libs SHUTUP,\" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's \"Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)\" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. \"My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,\" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. \"We stand against discrimination.\" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. \"Before you go and get too self-righteous w/ your #BoycottIndiana,\" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, \"@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nSocial media supporters of Indiana's \"religious freedom\" bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs.\nOpponents of the bill say its \"freedom\" is a cover for bigotry against gays and lesbians.\nSome Indiana businesses tweet that they will continue to serve all customers, regardless of orientation.\nSome users take to social media in attempt to organize boycott of Indiana ."}

The proposals will only hit babies born after the law has been changed and could save the Government £300million a year. At the moment there are around 320,000 families with four or more children. The Chancellor George Osborne is resisting proposals from the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to cap child benefit at three children . Child benefit is paid to families with children under 16 – or under 20 if they are in education or training. But since 2013 families with one parent earning more than £50,000 a year have been excluded from claiming the benefit. It currently pays £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. James Browne, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the move would eventually save hundreds of millions of pounds  – but not for another 18 years because it only affects babies born after the law is changed. Child benefit is paid families with children under 16 - or under 20 if they are in education or training - and is worth £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has previously proposed a two-child limit, but George Osborne is understood to have rejected it. The Treasury is now ‘softening’ to the idea and is examining the details. Tory MP Dominic Raab said it was not purely about cost but could ‘send a message about personal responsibility’. He said: ‘There is a much broader point than just the financial bean counting,’ he said. ‘It's the kind of welfare system we want - do we want a social safety net or are we saying that welfare is somehow a lifestyle choice? ‘And I think we do want the welfare system to send a message about personal responsibility, and yes that includes parents saving and taking some responsibility for the size of their family, making sure it's according to their means.’ But Labour MP Dame Anne Begg said people did not have children for child benefit and asked ‘why pick on’ large families. She said: ‘I don't think you have a child because you're going to get an extra... £13.55 a week.’ Dame Anne added: ‘Only one in seven families have three or more children - it's a small number - so why pick on them?’", "completion": "response:\n\nControversial proposal would only hit babies born after rule is introduced .\nAt the moment there are around 320,000 families with four or more children .\nChild benefit paid to  under 16s - or under 20s in education or training .\nIt is worth £20.50 a week for a first child, then £13.55 for other children .\nWork and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is championing the plan ."}

It's not as easy when it comes to health care. The truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $4,000 to as much as $14,000, depending on the city, according to new data compiled by Gawker. Using data from HealthSparq, the website charted eight common procedures and compared how much they cost in Washington, DC; New York City; Miami; Houston; Los Angeles and San Francisco. Random: New data shows the difference in price for common health care procedures in six cities across the U.S. Above, the cost of undergoing a tonsillectomy varies as much as $10,000 . Common procedure: The cost of undergoing an appendectomy hovers around $14,000 in most cities, but is a steal in Washington DC at $9,000 . The results will certainly have Houston residents driving to Los Angeles if they want to undergo a carpal tunnel procedure. A carpal tunnel release procedure at a surgical center in Houston costs upwards of $20,000 - while the price of the same procedure in the other cities hover between $5,000 and $8,000. Herniated disc decompression surgery costs $15,000 in Washington and more than three and a half times more in Houston and Los Angeles - more than $48,000. A simply tonsillectomy will run $3,500 in Washington - but costs $14,000 in San Francisco. The reason health care costs are not widely advertised stems from the fact that they vary based on who ends up paying - and insurers don't like revealing the negotiated final amount. However, there has been a recent push towards price transparency. Some states have  started making databses of health care costs based on insurance claims and other insurance data. You can also research the costs of health care further on websites like HealthcareBlueBook.com. Ouch: Decompressing a herniated disc at a surgical center in Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York costs around the same as four years of college . Astronomical: Houston has an exceptionally high cost for a carpal tunnel release at a surgical center compared to the rest of the cities . Simple: It costs about twice the amount to undergo a outpatient carpal tunnel procedure in Miami than it does in New York City .", "completion": "response:\n\nCharts show differences in price for common medical procedure in six U.S. cities .\nPrices for a procedure like a tonsillectomy can range between $4,000 and $14,000 ."}

Police in Pomona, California -- about 30 miles east of L.A -- issued an arrest warrant Monday for Henry Solis, an LAPD rookie, in the shooting death of a local man over the weekend. According to witnesses, shots were fired in the predawn hours Saturday after a struggle between a shooter and a victim before a compact car was seen rushing off. The victim -- identified as 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. -- later died at a Los Angeles hospital. Investigators looking for clues discovered an abandoned car about three blocks away from the scene that belonged to Solis. Authorities soon began looking for the 27-year-old cop to question him, but so far, he has not turned up. \"The suspect knows he is wanted, and that police are actively searching for him.,\" Pomona police said in a statement. The LAPD is helping them look for him. Solis, who is still in his probationary phase, was off duty when the killing happened and has not reported back since. Police have not said how Solis may have been involved in the killing, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Residents have built a memorial to Rodriguez, a trucker, at the street corner where he collapsed.

Ibrahimovic will face a French Football League (LFP) disciplinary commission hearing on April 9 over comments he made after PSG's 3-2 loss to Bordeaux on March 15. The Swede was at the time caught on camera saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.' Zlatan Ibrahimovic swore loudly as he walked towards the changing room after PSG's defeat to Bordeaux . Ibrahimovic, during his rant, claimed France was 's***' but has now insisted that he likes the country . French sports minister Patrick Kanner had called on Ibrahimovic to apologise, which he later did in a social media post, and the mercurial forward has once again played down the impact of his rant. At a press conference ahead of Sweden's Euro 2016 qualifier against Moldova, Ibrahimovic, in quotes reported in the Swedish media, said: 'I like it in France. 'I would not have played there for so long and I would not have renewed my contract if I did not like it.

Ibrahimovic does, however, want a greater emphasis placed on referees, adding: 'We the players are punished, but not the referee.'

His tackle on Oscar earned him a straight red, though PSG did progress in the end, but Ibrahimovic feels the Brazilian had played his part in the referee's decision. 'Play-acting does not belong in my world and I play to win,' Ibrahimovic said. 'I will do anything to win, but play-acting? Not that.

And it just happened to a five-year-old from northern Vietnam. A picture of a little girl crying by a dog she believed to be her pet has quickly gone viral on the internet, according to People's Daily Online. The unidentified girl reportedly lives in the countryside of north Vietnam.  She had raised a dog 'Flower' for three years and was deeply saddened when her beloved pet went missing mysteriously.

She has searched for the dog for a few days after it went missing mysteriously . She had spent great effort searching for 'Flower', but to no avail. A few days later, when the child passed by a local dog meat stall, she instantly recognised a dog lying on the street - and already cooked. 'That's Flower,' cried the girl while rushing over to the dog. The picture broke the heart of hundreds of thousands on the internet. Many agreed that the tragedy is too much for a five-year-old to take and have appealed for a ban on the consumption of dog meat. Dog meat is treated as a delicacy in several Asian countries, including Korea, Vietnam and China.

They deserved credit for coming back to win. ‘But there’s no pressure on us, the players can go and express themselves.’ Everton are 16th in the Premier League after a campaign disrupted by their participation in Europe.

In a speech to staff, Tony Hall will say he backs plans to overhaul the licence fee ‘to reflect changing times’. Lord Hall reveals he is open to a new universal levy on every household in the country – even those that do not own a television set or only watch programmes online or on catch-up services. BBC director-general Tony Hall, who says he will back plans to overhaul the licence fee 'to reflect changing times' This would lead to an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free. The director-general’s speech at Broadcasting House in London comes just a week after a report by the MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said the £145.50-a-year TV licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced. The debate has stepped up a gear as negotiations on renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter in 2016 get under way. Expressing the BBC’s view, Lord Hall is expected to say: ‘We’ve always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times. ‘I welcome the committee’s endorsement of our proposal to make people pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch-up television. ‘The committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee – a universal household levy.

But ministers say the earliest it could be introduced would be 2026. A subscription system advocated by the select committee, is opposed by Lord Hall as ‘poor value’. He will warn that it could fatally diminish the BBC’s ability to compete on digital platforms with other providers such as Netflix, Google and Apple.", "completion": "response:\n\nBBC director-general Tony Hall made a speech at Broadcasting House .\nSaid he will back plans to overhaul licence fee 'to reflect changing times'\nWill be aimed at those who don't own a TV or only watch catch-up services .\nEstimated an extra 500,000 households will pay for a service they don't use .\nComes after licence fee was branded outdated in a report by MPs last week ."}

But the students' principal was hardly excited by the grand gesture. 'I was there for a bit and I knew people would come like security so I tried to leave,' Gonzales told the San Jose Mercury News.

Sharper on Monday admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case. He appeared in the Phoenix courtroom by video-conferencing from Los Angeles. Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been sentenced to nine years in prison after pleading guilty . Sharper admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013  case . Sharper also is expected to change his plea in person in Los Angeles on similar allegations. Similar hearings will follow in Las Vegas this week and in New Orleans in April. The Arizona and California cases, combined with others in Nevada and Louisiana, are likely to lead to a long prison sentence. In each state, Sharper was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women when they were unconscious or otherwise unable to resist or consent. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Warren Granville said Sharper will serve his time in federal custody and that the Louisiana case will be resolved through a federal court. In Arizona, Sharper admitted sexually assaulting one victim, though police say he drugged and sexually assaulted three women, at an apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe in November. The 39-year-old was part of the New Orleans Saints side which won the NFL Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 . Authorities say a search of the Tempe apartment turned up a shot glass with a white residue that turned out to be zolpidem, and California investigators discovered that Sharper had a prescription for the drug. Last year, Sharper's attorneys said their client did not make the drinks that authorities say he used to drug the women. One of the women told police she hadn't had any alcohol that night until Sharper insisted she drink a shot. Another young woman said she had been drugged, then went to bed, locked her door and wasn't attacked. The next day, one of the women confronted Sharper, who denied wrongdoing, according to the reports. The reports said Sharper was in Arizona to visit a woman who lived at the apartment. The two had met about a year earlier in Las Vegas.

Spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a cardinal in charge of St Peter's Basilica, which Michelangelo also helped to design, had been offered the documents for 'a certain price'. Rome newspaper Il Messaggero said the person, described as a former Vatican employee, had asked for 100,000 euros (£72,000). The Vatican said a cardinal was sent a ransom demand asking for £72,000 to return two letters by Renaissance master Michelangelo (pictured, St Peter's Basilica, which the artist helped to design) This is the first time the Vatican has acknowledged the theft of the two letters, one of which supposedly contains Michelangelo's signature. Lombardi said the cardinal 'naturally refused because these are stolen documents'. He added that a nun who worked in the Vatican archives informed officials back in 1997 that the documents had gone missing, but he did not say why the Vatican had not disclosed the theft before. While the newspaper spoke of only one letter signed by Michelangelo, who lived from 1475 to 1564, the spokesman said two documents had gone missing. He added that Vatican police were now investigating the case with their Italian counterparts. No further details have been given about either of the documents, which were taken from the archives of the Fabbrica di San Pietro which looks after the upkeep of the basilica. The demand is believed to have come from a former Vatican employee. Until a spokesman confirmed the threat, it was not known that the documents had been taken back in 1997 . However, The Times reports the signed letter is believed to discuss art commissioned by the Pope. The archives contain numerous documents concerning the history, design and construction of vast holy site. The basilica took more than 100 years to build and was completed in 1626. Michelangelo took over the construction of the basilica in January 1547, while in his seventies, after the death of Pope Paul III's preferred candidate, Giulio Romano. Drawing on the complex plans laid down by a chain of architects before him, Michelangelo brought them together into a workable model, and is responsible for much of the basilica as it stands today.", "completion": "response:\n\nVatican says it was sent demand by man believed to be a former employee .\nNun reported that the letters, one of them signed, were missing in 1997 .\nBut until yesterday the public knew nothing about the letters being taken ."}

While the rest of the English Super League clubs spend two or even three nights on their annual trips to the south of France, the Rhinos charter their own plane to get them in and out of the city on the day of the game. It is a move that has paid off so far, with Brian McDermott's men winning on each of their last three trips to the Stade Gilbert Brutus, and the coach believes it could be even more important this time with the hectic Easter programme coming up. Leeds Rhinos boss Brian McDermott set for clash with Catalan Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday . 'There's a lot of meticulous planning involved but it's something we prefer to do and it's a more efficient way of doing it,' McDermott said. 'Sometimes we don't treat our players as robustly as they should be treated, certainly in terms of travel. 'It's worked well for us. I don't think travelling on the day of the game is as detrimental as you would imagine, although I wouldn't do it every single weekend. 'What it does do is help you recover for the following game. The players get to spend the night before they travel in their own bed and on the night of the game they're back in their own bed again, albeit later than normal.' The Dragons have also chartered their own plane for trips to England but they spent last week in Manchester to take in back-to-back away games against the two Hull clubs. Brad Singleton of Leeds Rhinos scores his teams third try of the game against Wigan last week . That exercise can only be described as a failure after Laurent Frayssinous' men lost both games, conceding 83 points in the process, but McDermott expects them to be back to their formidable best back on French soil, where they are unbeaten so far this year. 'I am sure they will be good,' McDermott said. 'They'll be determined to turn things around. Every team has a tussle with them when they go out there.' Saturday's meeting between the clubs will be the first since the Catalans ended Leeds' play-off hopes with a dramatic 24-20 triumph at Headingley last September. Leeds are still without skipper Kevin Sinfield, as well as prop Kylie Leuluai and winger Tom Briscoe, so Liam Sutcliffe, Ash Handley and Andy Yates keep their places following the win over Wigan.

Word of the lawsuit comes a day after the Justice Department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge Wilson in Brown's death but found in a separate investigation that the Ferguson Police Department showed a pattern of racial bias. Brown Sr. and McSpadden released a statement Wednesday saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face charges, but, they added, the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining. \"We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,\" the statement said. \"It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain.\" In November, a grand jury cleared Wilson and, in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered. Gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on \"pretty much the same evidence,\" but it will be cast differently. The jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, Parks said.

Loblaws, Canada's largest food retailer, is selling ‘ugly’ groceries that are up to 30 per cent cheaper than more aesthetically pleasing products .

The supermarket said that produce in the Naturally Imperfect program was previously used in juices, sauces or soups, or may not have been harvested due to their small size . Loblaw senior vice president Ian Gordon pointed out that customers often put too much stock in the look of food. He said in a statement: ‘We often focus too much on the look of produce rather than the taste. Once you peel or cut an apple you can't tell it once had a blemish or was misshapen. ‘No Name Naturally Imperfect is a great example of Loblaw and our vendors coming together to find an innovative way to bring nutritious food options to consumers at a great price.’ The supermarket said that produce in the Naturally Imperfect program was previously used in juices, sauces or soups, or may not have been harvested due to their small size.

Weekend gales in St John's Wood have knocked the deathly steel figure parallel to the ground, but mercifully still in his elevated roof-top position with scythe and bail on stumps intact. The Father Time weathervane at Lord's has been bent almost 90 degrees by high winds . The famous weathervane has been at Lord's since 1926 after it was presented to the MCC .

Staff from Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns Lord's, are working with specialists to restore it to its original position as soon as possible. Lord's is due to host its first game of the season on Sunday, April 12 when Middlesex entertain Nottinghamshire in the LV= County Championship. This is not the first time the weathervane has fallen foul of the elements, back in 1992 it was struck by lightning and the subsequent repairs were featured on children's TV show Blue Peter. Father Time was given to MCC in 1926 by the architect of the Lord's Grand Stand, Sir Herbert Baker. During World War II, it was wrenched from its original perch when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon. Staff set about trying to repair and restore Father Time to it's original glory . Father Time tweeted to say he had been diagnosed with copper damage and will be undergoing treatment . It was reattached to the top of the Grand Stand where it sat until 1996 when it was relocated to the Mound Stand. The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16(3) of the Laws of Cricket: 'After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets.' But he has, as his name indicates, moved with the times - and tweets these days on behalf of Lord's Cricket Ground, including an update on his latest mishap. The two posts read: 'NEWS: I've was felled by high winds last night! Ouch! 'Apologies for my poor grammar in the previous tweet - but I'm not feeling my best after being damaged last night!'

Jardim, whose side beat the Gunners on away goals in the last 16 of the competition, said Wenger left for the changing rooms early rather than shaking his hands after the Ligue 1 side's impressive 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg. The Portuguese boss thus decided not to thank the 65-year-old following Arsenal's 2-0 victory in the return fixture. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim reacts on the pitch at the end of their Champions League win on away goals . Arsene Wenger said he wanted to shake Leonardo Jardim's hand at the final whistle but he was celebrating . The Monaco coach claims he did so as Wenger didn't congratulate him after the first-leg victory . Speaking after their progression to the quarter-finals, Jardim said: 'In the first leg, when I wanted to thank Arsene and shake his hand, it's true that Arsene didn't shake my hand, so even though Monaco did everything to make life comfortable for Arsenal tonight, I decided not to thank him. 'I think it was disrespectful. Right now, we're celebrating and we think Arsenal did not show enough respect during the first leg.' Wenger though insists such claims are lies, and says Jardim was too busy celebrating with his team to notice that the Arsenal boss had waited to congratulate him in north London.

Sportsmail can reveal that Pietersen has told Surrey, who released him at the end of last summer, that he will not play all county cricket for them next season — even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves. He appeared to call Pietersen’s bluff by saying the 34-year-old would be considered for an England recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Yet it seems unlikely the county will be Surrey, who have not been able to reach agreement with Pietersen over a deal to play in red-ball cricket as well as the white-ball game. The fact Pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year’s Indian Premier League, before Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him in a cut-price deal, seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket. But unless Pietersen is prepared to move away from London — something he previously stated he would not do — it seems that his options are diminishing. Leicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division. A return for Pietersen in England colours (above) is now looking more and more unlikely . Somerset, coached by Pietersen’s friend Matt Maynard, remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for England. Graves, who does not succeed Giles Clarke as chairman until May 15, appeared to go against the wishes of senior figures in the England set-up when he seemed to endorse a Pietersen recall. Pietersen, playing for Melbourne Stars, waits to bat in the Big Bash League semi-final in January .", "completion": "response:\n\nSportsmail can reveal that Kevin Pietersen has told Surrey that he will not play all county cricket for them next season .\nPietersen struggled to get a contract in this year’s Indian Premier League .\nLeicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division ."}

The move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries, including India, backed it. Speaking against the proposal, US ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said: “We must speak plainly about what Russia tried to do today… diminish the authority of the UN secretary general and export to the UN its domestic hostility to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) rights.” The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. (File picture) India went with the Russian proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations. The UN extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries. But last year, secretary general Ban Ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws. The Russian envoy at the UN had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body. This is also perhaps the reason for India to back the Russian proposal. While Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were the other countries on India’s side, 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all. India’s own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate. Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the Supreme Court last year. There is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the Supreme Court. After their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on January 28, 2014, the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on April 3, 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court. The apex court said the government’s indecision and flip-flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation. The Bench, which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of Parliament, questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a Law Commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands. The court said this proved that the Centre wanted the section to remain in the statute.", "completion": "response:\n\nIndia voted to support a proposal by Russia, to deny gay couples working for the UN staff benefits .\nThe move was defeated by 80 votes to 43 ."}

But this giant wok of ‘dragon beard’ noodles, made for 2,000 people at a temple in Henan province in central China, took it to the next level. The temple put on the incredible feast in celebration of ‘Dragon Head Raising Day’, which is marked across the country by various traditions that have been passed on down the years, reported the People's Daily Online.

Legend has it that on this day the dragon, an important symbol in Chinese culture, will awaken and bring rain to produce a bumper harvest. It is considered good luck to eat foods that are named after body parts of the dragon, including ‘dragon beard’ noodles, ‘dragon’s ears’ dumplings and ‘dragon’s scales’ pancakes. Earlier this month, chefs at the White Dragon Temple in Fucheng village used four massive woks to cook noodles for visitors that came from miles around to pray for good fortune and prosperity. Amazingly, all the food was gone within an hour. The feast on ‘Dragon Head Raising Day’, celebrated on the second day of the second lunar month, is particularly significant because it is believed to ward off diseases. The ‘dragon beard’ noodles are extraordinarily fine and made by hand. They symbolise longevity, which is why it is unlucky to cut them when you are eating. Just three pounds of wheat flour can be made into 144,000 hair-like noodles, according to experts. When the noodles are made, one rope of dough is stretched up to 12 times to produce thousands of strands. It is reported that some masters of the art are able to make noodles so fine that one strand can be threaded through the eye of a needle.

Viet Quoc Nguyen, 28, is charged with hacking at least eight email service providers between February 2009 and June 2012 and obtaining more than one billion email addresses. The service providers involved were not named. According to the allegations, Nguyen and fellow Vietnamese citizen Giang Hoang Vu, 25, used the data to send so-called spam to tens of millions of people directing them to products they were selling online. Hacked: The data breach compromised almost one billion email addresses across the United States from February 2009 to June 2012 . Both men resided in the Netherlands. Vu, who was extradited to the United States in March of last year, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Nguyen remains at large. The other defendant, Canadian David-Manuel Santos Da Silva, 33, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is the co-owner of a company called 21 Celsius Inc, that allegedly struck up a marketing arrangement with Nguyen and Vu to generate revenue and launder the proceeds, according to the Justice Department. The two men made $2 million from sales on those products over two years. “Those individuals who line their pockets with money gained through deceiving others should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Veronica F.

Police reportedly received two phone calls - one from McCarty and one from the father of the five-month-old baby, Chris Swift, who arrived home to find the children unconscious, according to WPTV. McCarty, pictured left with partner Chris Swist and her two eldest children Laci and Philip and right again with Chris Swist, was treated for injuries and put into custody . McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. Police Chief Mark Renkens said that McCarty 'has a bit of a history', having been convicted of acquiring a controlled substance by fraud and violating parole in 2013 and a reckless driving charge that was reduced from a DUI in 2009. McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV.

He’s not a chairman that gets to know the football club. I can feel that relationship. I had his support when we were flying in the league, when we were flying in Europe and I’ve got his support when we haven’t been able to get the wins we wanted in the league. ‘He is always supportive and hands on in terms of helping and that’s where a manager can be at his best – when he feels the support of his chairman.

The Russian President had been due to make a visit to Kazakhstan this week but an official there said it had been cancelled because he was ill. Mr Putin also failed to appear at an annual meeting of high-ranking officers from the Federal Security Service today, an event he has attended in past years. Scroll down for video . Last public appearance: Vladimir Putin with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Russia last week . It was claimed the crisis over Ukraine and murder of an opposition politician may have caused a collapse in Mr Putin's health. But another theory, advanced by the lawyer of murdered Boris Nemtsov, was that the strongman may be lying low because he is 'afraid' of an assassination bid. Rumours: The Ukraine crisis may have contributed to a collapse in Putin's health, it has been claimed . Putin loves to be seen as an ever-present action man, but the Russian president has been absent from public view for a week. The 62 year old's unusual absence has dented his tough-guy image. His aides scrambled to explain he was healthy and his macho handshake remained so strong 'it breaks your hand'. Putin was last seen in public when he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 5 March. Official pictures have emerged of meetings since then, but rumours say these in fact took place earlier before his sudden and unexplained disappearance. Nemtsov's lawyer claimed Putin may be scared over the high profile murder yards from the Kremlin, suggesting the Russian leader maybe in hiding fearing an assassination bid. 'Perhaps Putin, even completely sincerely, was bewildered and even afraid,' said Vadim Prokhorov. 'Because if you can do that next to the Kremlin, then is it not possible to do it along the route of the presidential motorcade?' Spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the health speculation over Putin as 'spring fever'. The leader was 'holding meetings all the time' to solve the 'crisis'. 'There is no need to worry. Everything is fine,' said Peskov, not explaining why Putin did not make an appearance to disarm the rumour-mongers. The spate of speculation over his condition recalled regular health scares over his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and a clutch of geriatric Soviet leaders.", "completion": "response:\n\nPutin's visit to Kazakhstan was cancelled because he was ill, official said .\nHe also failed to appear at annual meeting of high-ranking officers today .\nClaimed Ukraine crisis may have contributed to collapse in his health .\nPresident was last seen in public when he met with Italian PM last week ."}

The Des Moines Register reports that while Young did know she was pregnant, she did not know just how far along she was with her new baby, thinking she was only 12 weeks along at the time. As for the speedy labor, that is likely due to the fact that Young has had three other labors in just the past few years. 'I've been in shock for the last couple of days, because I didn't expect a full-term baby,' Young said. 'With my other kids, I had like three or four pushes.

The Germany international has failed to score in his 11 appearances so far for the Nerazzurri and has come under intense scrutiny from the Italian press, with some outlets even branding him as the worst signing of the season. But Podolski feels that these attacks are unfair and counter productive to him rediscovering his form. 'People keep bringing up how the Italian media looks at me,' he said, 'What can I do about it? Should I just dig myself into the ground and give up playing football?' Inter Milan forward Lukas Podolski has hit back at critics of his performances since joining the club . Podolski joined Inter on loan from Arsenal in January but has so far struggled to make an impact in Serie A . While Podolski might be struggling at club level, his international career has suffered no such dip. The 29-year-old came off the bench to score his 48th goal for Germany, a dramatic late equaliser in their 2-2 draw with Australia on Wednesday. That goal has now placed Podolski third in his country's all-time leading scoring charts and he is keen to carry on being part of the international set-up. 'I have always been part of the team and I hope this will continue to be the case,' he said.

Defeat at Murrayfield today would ensure a fourth wooden spoon and third whitewash in 12 years for the home side, who have been relegated to a mere sideshow in what is set to be thrilling finish to this year’s tournament. Adam Ashe is determined to spoil the Irish party at Murrayfield on Saturday . The day kicks off with Italy playing Wales at the Stadio Olimpico, before Scotland host Ireland and then England round things off against France at Twickenham. Wales, Ireland and England are all locked on six points each, with the destination of the title set to be decided on points difference. As things stand, England are in the driving seat with a points difference of 37 from their first four games, with Ireland on 33 and Wales off the pace with 12. The Irish will be determined to run in the tries against Scotland, so as to apply pressure to Stuart Lancaster’s men when the take on the temperamental French. Ashe, for his part, is determined to spoil the party. ‘Ireland are focusing on a big win and looking forward to taking the title but we don’t want to let that happen, regardless who goes on to win the Championship,’ said the Glasgow Warriors forward. Ashe doesn't think his selection was a gamble for such an important match . ‘I would say there is more pressure on us going into this match because we have been losing games while playing well. ‘Yes, Ireland have got a lot of pressure on them to win the Championship — but that could be taken out of their hands by us.’ Ashe, who has been brought into the Scotland side at the expense of Rob Harley, denied it was a gamble throwing him in from the start of a such an important match.

That was always going to happen coming back from my injury. ‘Although I have not played much rugby, I am hungry for it. I am not just physically ready but also mentally ready, too.

Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo’s unpaid bill is part of the £62million cost of ‘health tourism’ to Britain. The 34-year-old, an advertising executive in Africa, was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital when the maternity suite was reopened. New mother: Zimbabwe-born Caroline Nyadzayo (left) was pictured with health minister Daniel Poulter (right) on his visit to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the maternity suite . The mother said she complained to Mr Poulter about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it. But Mr Poulter has reportedly said he does not remember being told that. Miss Nyadzayo, now in Harare, told The Sunday Times it was ‘unfair’ she was still being pursued, because the baby’s father is British. She said: ‘I know the system may believe I travelled [to Britain] to abuse the NHS benefits, but as a matter of fact I just wanted to have my first baby as a family and surely everyone is entitled to that.’ The couple were questioned about the birth when they entered Britain at Norwich Airport in October 2013. However, they were released when they agreed they would be paying for it. Discussion: The mother said she complained to Mr Poulter at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (pictured) about the charge and said she was under huge pressure to pay it . Miss Nyadzayo said: ‘I was told because I was 31 weeks pregnant it was likely I was going to use the NHS to my advantage. We said we would pay for the birth. But we had no idea how much we’d be charged.’ Her case was profiled as figures suggested hospitals’ failure to claw back the cost of treating Europeans is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week. The so-called ‘health tourism gap’ between the amount the NHS collects from EU patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from Britain has soared to almost £700million. It means the UK is now paying out £15 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill abroad for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors.

They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world. Ella's series, \"First and foremost I am,\" consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21, the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavík Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on \"the beauty and diversity of mankind\" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable. \"I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world.\" The title of the series, \"First and foremost I am,\" comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project. \"I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora,\" Jonsdottir writes. \"I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies.\" Jonsdottir goes on to say, \"Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?\" Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects \"to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together.\" The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot. \"My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nSigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old .\nShe hopes her photos shine a light on \"the beauty and diversity of mankind\""}

Initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane, his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the Californian landscape on his camera. So far so good: The skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over Perris, California . But suddenly, the bridle, which connects the pilot chute – a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute – to the deployment bag containing the parachute, wraps around the pilot chute. It then appears that the reserve parachute, which is automatically deployed via an RSL (reserve static line) system after cutting away from the main parachute, becomes tangled. This sends the skydiver spiralling out of control, and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft.

Last week, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said the £145.50-a-year charge was ‘anachronistic’ and should be scrapped within the next decade in favour of a flat-rate broadcast levy on all households. But Lord Hall, the Corporation’s director-general, insisted yesterday that the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’, adding: ‘I think it could go well beyond that.’ Not dead yet: BBC Director-general Lord Tony Hall has said he believes the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’ Even if the fee is axed, he said it should be replaced by an equivalent charge. Despite MPs painting a damning picture of the BBC – which they said had blown billions of pounds of licence fee payers’ money trying to be ‘all things to all people’ – Lord Hall was optimistic. 'I think the committee’s report should really be commended because they have raised something which says, you know what, the licence fee isn’t dead,’ he said. ‘The BBC ain’t dead.

Yesterday, Lord Hall backed the proposal, but said it was simply ‘another way of the licence fee being modernised’. But he also warned that the BBC risks ‘sleepwalking into decay’ unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users’ data. Lord Hall said the Corporation is in danger of becoming ‘irrelevant’ if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services, in a similar way to Amazon and Netflix.

The Argentina international was approaching the end of his previous deal but has now committed until the end of the 2015-16 season. Demichelis, 34, has become an important member of City's defensive unit after an initially shaky start following his move to the Etihad Stadium in September 2013. Martin Demichelis (left) has signed a new one-year deal with Manchester City . 'I want to say that I am really proud and happy to have extended my contract for another year,' Demichelis told the club's official website. 'Manchester City is a club with a lot of ambition. We want to grow every year. 'When you get to hold a trophy, it's the best feeling for any player. 'I want to say that I will fight for this club and for my team-mates until the end of my contract. I will fight to try and win titles.' Demichelis worked with City manager Manuel Pellegrini at River Plate and Malaga and followed the Chilean to Manchester from the Spanish club via a brief, appearanceless, stint at Atletico Madrid. He also had a successful nine-year spell at Bayern Munich earlier in his career and was a member of the Argentina side that reached last year's World Cup final. His early appearances for City were not impressive but he improved considerably after the nadir of a red card in a Champions League loss to Barcelona in February last year. Demichelis overcame a shaky start to his City career to establish himself in the back four . He played a key role in the season run-in that culminated with title success and he has made 30 appearances this season.

The infamous ‘sex-in-a-motel claim’ rumbled on for six years after the woman suffered cuts to her nose and mouth as well as ‘psychological injuries’. This all came about when a glass light fitting was pulled from the wall of the motel room as she had ‘vigorous’ sex with a local man in Nowra in November 2007. Public Service Minister Eric Abetz is making changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering' Public Service Minister Eric Abetz revealed the cost of the claim as he engineered changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering’, by Commonwealth bureaucrats. The unidentified 'libidinous' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000, including the costs of the bureaucrat's own lawyers and barristers. ‘The flaws in the system were highlighted in lurid terms by the infamous \"hotel room sex case\", where a Commonwealth public servant successfully sought workers compensation for an injury sustained on a work trip, after hours, while engaging in sexual activity,’ the minister says in The Canberra Times.

The loophole was inadvertently opened the day before, when an appeals court invalidated one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The court ruled that Irish governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to Section 2 of the law for decades. \"We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,\" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. \"The emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.\" The emergency law moved through the Irish legislature and was signed by the President on Wednesday, meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight, a Department of Health spokeswoman told CNN. Varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or \"head shop\" drugs -- \"all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits,\" according to the Irish Times. The original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis, cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal.

'If you're mindful of how you're approaching your life, then you see the connection. You can't avoid the connection. 'The connection between food, illness, environment. I want to see everything as a whole, so that's how I approach life, and that's how it comes into my business.'

Take it one step further. Instead of bees hovering around a tree, imagine cheese balls. Solo cups in the place of birds, glow sticks as locusts.

Jackson grew up in Rhode Island and worked in publishing in New York for 13 years, ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with Forbes magazine. But somewhere along the way, he picked up a camera. He found photography \"effortlessly fulfilling\" compared to the frequent challenges of writing. So he dove in, lens first.

More than half of Jackson's \"Emergent Behavior\" series is digitally untouched. How Jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical.

Scroll down for video . A five-year-old California boy suffered a 'minor puncture' when a Sea Lion bit him in the face in San Diego . The boy was with his family at La Jolla Cove (pictured) when he tried to pet the sea lion on Sunday . At least two sea lion attacks have been reported in the last three months, Fox 5 reported. The San Diego Fire and Rescue Department says the boy suffered a 'minor puncture' to his jaw. His family took him to a local hospital for examination. The incident was reported to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the LA Times reported. There have been a record number of sea lions washing up on Southern California beaches in 2015. Nearly 2,000 of the animals have washed up on the state's shores in sick and starving conditions so far this year. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sounded the alarm over the surge in famished pups, saying there has been 'an unusually large increase' in sea lion strandings. In January and February, strandings were 20 times the average rate for those two months. Experts believe warming sea temperatures might be responsible for the enormous rise in strandings because the availability of fish and other sea lion food sources has been affected.

Hearing documents from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia reported that the woman had received more than she was eligible for due to 'an error by Centrelink', even after she had inquired whether she was still getting the correct payment. Tribunal member Mr C. Ermert wrote that 'incorrect coding on her computer record' meant she continued to receive benefit payments 'even though her income exceeded the level at which they ceased to be payable'. A woman received $94,219.84 more than she was eligible for from Centrelink over 10 years due to a computer error . In early 2011, the woman reported to Centrelink that her and her partner's estimated combined annual income had increased to $274,479. However a senior practitioner confirmed that she was still eligible to continue receiving the same rate of Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Benefit and Schoolkids Bonus. It was not until April of 2014 that a Centrelink worker noticed the error and ordered the woman to repay a total of $94,219.84 worth of debts. Despite the woman admitting that 'a debt recovery plan would not cause her financial hardship', she challenged the decision, claiming that 'she was not responsible for debts caused by the Department's errors.' The Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia has ordered that she must repay $17,248.18 . The Tribunal documents stated that she 'answered consistently that she noticed nothing untoward about the level of benefits until 2011, when her husband's salary increased significantly, giving them more disposable income. 'It was then that she raised the issue with Centrelink. Up to that time she trusted the Department to make the correct payments.' While the errors were recognised as being solely the governments fault, the Tribunal still ruled that she had to repay the $17,248.18 that she received from 2012 onward due to legislation regarding timeframes. Repayments for over $77,000 that she received before 2012 were waived.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe woman was overpaid for 10 years due to an error by Centrelink .\nShe reported an increased combined income in 2011 but was still found eligible for a number of benefits until 2014 .\nAdministrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia ordered she repay $17,248.18 ."}

In the serious injury, a person's thigh was impaled by a piece of debris early Saturday, the city said in a statement. Scroll down for video . A roof collapsed early Saturday morning as 30 college students were partying and dancing at a St. Fratty's Day party . The 1,000 people at the party were mostly students at California Polytechnic State University . Eight others were treated for cuts and bruises. None of the injuries are life-threatening. The off-campus party, which was not affiliated in any way with the college, drew about 1,000 students, and hundreds could still be seen partying in a video that showed the exact moment the roof collapsed.

'Our thoughts are with those injured, and we wish them a speedy recovery. Cal Poly is also in close contact with local public safety agencies as they work to determine exactly what occurred.

The Airbus A330's crew first tried landing the plane around 7 a.m. Wednesday (8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday), getting very close to a runway but not touching down, according to passenger Deepak Malhotra. That was followed by an announcement that the aircraft couldn't land due to poor visibility. About 45 minutes later, though, the crew tried again. This time, the Turkish Airlines plane did get on the ground but it didn't stay on the runway, according to airport officials. The aircraft skidded off, screeching to a stop with its nose pitched down. Pictures showed passengers and crew going down evacuation slides and walking through heavy fog. Despite the rough landing, there were no reports of serious injuries, according to a Turkish Airlines spokesman. Still, the incident did manage to knock out air travel in and out of the Tribhuvan International Airport, the only way in for foreigners wanting to explore Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains. That's because part of the now-immobile Airbus A330 was covering a section of the runway.

The episode marks the first rescue of a leatherback sea turtle in South Carolina and is believed to be only the fifth live rescue of this species in the United States, according to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The endangered turtle was found stranded on the Yawkey-South Island Preserve, a wildlife refuge near Georgetown, South Carolina. Rescuers named it Yawkey. Because the turtle is believed to be a juvenile -- rescuers say it's probably less than 10 years old -- and has not reached sexual maturity, biologists can't yet determine its sex. Rescuers found no external signs of trauma to the reptile, although it was hypoglycemic. Staffers with the aquarium's sea turtle rescue program gave it antibiotics, vitamins and some time to recover at their facilities. The treatments appear to be helping. Aquarium officials said the turtle was more energetic Tuesday than when it was first admitted. Even so, leatherback turtles historically don't do well in captivity. For that reason, aquarium staffers are working with the state's Department of Natural Resources to determine the best place and time to release the turtle back into the ocean -- most likely within the next few days. Leatherbacks are the largest turtles on Earth and can grow up to 2,000 pounds.

'Drunk and high': This bottle - seemingly of alcohol - is waved around during the footage, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times . At one point in the video, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times, a voice is heard shouting: 'We chillin' with a owl [sic] right now, we vibin'' Alongside the video, Duverson wrote: '3am in the morning, we are drunk, we are high, we bout to take this thing home and eat it up just found it on the road.'

In a later post he said the bird was 'dancing' and 'acting crazy' during their 10-mile journey down the I-95 highway, which ended at Lake Worth. Wildlife experts were horrified at the video, and pointed out that possessing an owl in any capacity is a breach of federal wildlife laws.

Dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker offers some alternatives: . Poor olive harvests last year may mean a shortage of olive oil - so here are some alternatives . Best to roast veg: Rapeseed . Rapeseed oil has 6 per cent saturated fat compared with olive oil's 14.3 per cent. It also has ten times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids and 50 per cent more vitamin E. EXPERT VERDICT: One of the healthiest oils, with a subtle, grassy taste. One concern with heating oil is how soon it starts to smoke. This is when the fatty acids in it oxidise, creating harmful free radicals. Rapeseed oil has a high smoke point, so use for frying or roasting. Best in risotto: Rice bran . Taken from the bran (the vitamin-rich layer below the fibrous hull of rice) and germ (the oily, nutrient-rich part of a rice grain). High in protective antioxidants such as vitamin E. EXPERT VERDICT: As well as heart healthy vitamin E, this contains ferulic acid, which has powerful anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory effects, helping to protect the immune system and prevent disease. Coconut oil makes great stir-fries . Best in stir-fries: Coconut . Extracted from the white flesh of coconuts, this is almost 50 per cent lauric acid, a 'healthier' saturated fatty acid. Solid at room temperature, so can't be used for salad dressings, but its high smoke point makes it ideal for cooking. EXPERT VERDICT: Though it's 86.5 per cent saturated fat, research suggests the saturated fat in coconut may be used up more quickly by the body and is less likely to be stored as body fat. However, use in moderation. Best on salad: Walnut . With useful amounts of fatty acids, walnut oil may help lower heart disease risk. A distinct walnut flavour and low smoke point, so best for dressings. EXPERT VERDICT: Delicious, but not particularly versatile. Buy small bottles and keep in a cool, dark place as it goes rancid easily. Best for baking: Hemp seed . Richer in the essential fatty acids omega-3, 6 and 9 than other culinary oils, and has half the saturated fat of olive oil. One tablespoon provides 94 per cent of your daily recommended intake of omega-3s. EXPERT VERDICT: Versatile - can be used for stir-frying, dipping and salad dressing. One of the healthiest alternatives to olive oil, though the flavour may not be to everyone's taste. Disguise with dried fruit and spices. Rapeseed oil (l), walnut oil (c) and hemp seed oil (r) are all good for different dishes .", "completion": "response:\n\nDietitian Dr Sarah Schenker offers some alternatives to olive oil .\nRapeseed has lots more omega-3 fatty acids and is great with veg .\nCoconut oil makes great stir-fries and contains 'healthier' saturated fat ."}

Suddenly, one tourist catches a glimpse of the subject of one of the photos: a man whose eyes have been gouged out. Manjula Sharma, visiting the United Nations from India, gasps when she realizes what she is looking at. \"How could anybody do this?\" she said, while looking at the photos with a pained expression. \"It's not war. It's not drought. It's not natural calamity. It's torture.\" The exhibit is tucked away behind the lobby of the U.N. Secretariat Building. It's a no-frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called \"Caesar,\" a Syrian government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police. Caesar claimed to take up to 50 photos a day, and brought nearly 27,000 images like these out of the country. Captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals, and accuse Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in the torture and killings. The photos show emaciated bodies. Some have eyes gouged out, some have genitals removed. And many are covered with wounds, the flesh peeling from their bodies. It's a sight that gave pause to Anders Frantzen, who works at the United Nations and was running late to a meeting. \"I told myself I really wanted to come back here and take a proper look. It looks like something you haven't seen since the Second World War. It's very bad,\" Frantzen said. \"It's difficult to put a face, an image to the numbers we hear about. So you see these pictures (and) it sort of puts things in a new perspective.\" While the photos have been shown before Congress and in media reports, many people, like Sharma, had no idea they existed. That's partly why Mouaz Moustafa, senior political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, said he placed the photos in this location. He wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on U.N. Security Council member states to vote for the International Criminal Court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. \"If you ask anyone about ISIS from Mississippi to Alabama, everyone is so well aware of this obviously evil entity,\" Moustafa said. \"If you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the Assad regime, it doesn't get, I feel, it doesn't get the same coverage.\" The Syrian Mission to the United Nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit.

Ofcom also said it would be looking at changes in the prices charged by broadcasters for sports channels. BT Sport share the rights with Sky to broadcast Premier League football throughout the season . The regulator is in the midst of an investigation after Virgin argued that the English top flight screened fewer live matches than other top European leagues, contributing to higher prices for pay-TV packages.

The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead. Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community.

Filmmakers already on location in Rome and the southern city of Matera reportedly made a request to use the ancient stadium immortalised by the film in December. But it was feared the decision to bring hundreds of extras and heavy vehicles into a fragile archaeological site would lead to public outcry. The Circus Maximus (pictured) is an ancient site in Rome once used for the empire's deadly chariot races. Here it is pictured when it hosted the Live 8 concert in 2005 . The Circus Maximus was capable of holding hundreds of thousands of spectators during the chariot races . However, archaeologists said filming at the ancient site would cause 'irreparable damage' to the famous site . The rent of the ancient ground as a set for two weeks would have netted one million euros for the city’s cash-strapped coffers, Corriere della Sera reported. The classic chariot race scene - in which Ben Hur played by Charlton Heston competes against his nemesis Massala - will now be filmed in a purpose-built reproduction arena in Rome’s Cinecittà studios. The Circus Maximus was the centre of a row last summer when the Rolling Stones were allowed to use it for a concert. Heritage experts said the decision to allow 65,000 music fans to rampage over the area would cause irreparable damage to a ‘very fragile’ site. The millionaire rock band were charged just €8,000. The original 1959 Ben Hur film saw Charlton Heston filmed at the Circus Maximus in the movie's epic chariot race finale (pictured) The ancient arena has been used for pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005. But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns.

How? By a 124-year-old patent from 22 December 1891 which clearly illustrates an 'over' arrangement for toilet paper. Writer Owen Williams discovered the toilet paper patent online, and wasted no time in sharing his new-found information with his 8,000 followers on Twitter. The in-depth patent created by New York businessman Seth Wheeler clearly shows an 'over' arrangement . The patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets, New York business man Seth Wheeler. Wheeler, who was also the owner of the Albany Perforated Wrapping Sheet Company, undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way. Included in the patent, are Seth's declarations on his new product: 'Be it known that I, SETH WHEELER, of the city and county of Albany, and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Toilet-Paper Rolls.' Although there's no specific mention of the 'over' arrangement of the toilet paper, the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use. And it's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated; it's the state of the entire bathroom. Other key things to consider? Cleanliness. Etiquette expert William Hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit 'over', other bathroom tidiness is important: ‘I very much judge a house, and the house owner, by the state of their guest bathroom. ‘I would question the hygiene of the person's kitchen if the loo wasn’t spotless upon arrival. Finally, the age-old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved . ‘My own facilities for guests are half bathroom, half temple. ‘There’s no streaky chrome, or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven-knows what germs to fester. ‘If a guest doesn’t come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then I feel I have failed as a host; so many over-worry about their food, spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack, tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint, when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the Harpic.’", "completion": "response:\n\nThe argument that usually divides households has been settled via Twitter .\nAccording to Seth Wheeler, the man who invented toilet roll, it's 'over'\nWriter Owen Williams found the 1891 patent and tweeted to followers ."}

Captured on camera, Arteval Duarte holds what appear to be two BCC Boa Constrictors – native to South America – in his hands as he addresses the camera. He releases the snakes – also known as Red-tailed boas – and starts to blow up a balloon, dodging one of the snakes that lunges at him. The snakes watch him intently as the balloon he is inflating gets bigger and closer to them before violently lunging at him without warning. Bursting the balloon instantly, the snake comes incredibly close to puncturing the man's face. The viper then retreats back to its original position and Duarte begins to blow up another balloon. Arteval Duarte is known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ because of his many filmed encounters with snakes . Duarte moves closer to the Boa Constrictors while blowing up a balloon, causing one of them to strike . He repeats the dangerous feat three more times – the two snakes taking it in turns to pop the balloons as he compliments their intelligence. The video concludes with the snake ninja approaching the constrictors on the table and after dodging another lunge, grabbing and holding onto them. According to Duarte, the two snakes have been trained to obey his commands and bursting balloons from his mouth like this appears to be something they are used to doing. The motive for the stunt is in apparent protest against the deforestation of the Amazon. The mouth of the snake that bursts the balloon is only inches away from puncturing Duarte's face . Duarte blows up a total of four balloons and the two snakes appear to take it in turns bursting them . Arteval has specialised in performing bizarre stunts with snakes for 15 years to protest the deforestation of the Amazon . Arteval says that he dedicates his life to protecting the habitats of animals and that his videos bring attention to the problems.

It is the Dutch FA (KNVB) who are leading the way in trials of a system to aid referees. However, their bid to introduce the technology in cup matches from next season was rejected by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) last month. Referees chief Mike Riley has called for the arrival of video technology into the Premier League . Given the increasing number of controversies in the Premier League, referees’ chief Mike Riley has called for its arrival in the English top-flight. But the IFAB have delayed any decision for 12 months at least, meaning the earliest we could see video assistance for referees will be the 2017/18 season. The Dutch are certainly confident their process could work. It involves a fifth official located in a video room with access to instant replays. During Eredivisie games they have been trialling how long it would take that official to make a correct judgment on key incidents only, such as red cards, penalties and fouls before goals. They have found that an average of two to three crucial decisions per game can each be resolved within five to 20 seconds, with the official having a direct audio link to the referee. Should the IFAB give the go-ahead for trials of this system – or another one – in competitive matches during the 2016/17 campaign, they would then want to see it used in a FIFA age-grade tournament before giving permission for video technology to be implemented in the Premier League and elsewhere around the world. With Goal-line technology in use, and calls for videos to help with penalties and red cards too have risen too . Meanwhile, the notion of a ‘challenge system’ for managers has been rejected for fear of it being used for tactical gain. FA chairman Greg Dyke will offer his full backing to any attempts to expand the use of video technology and will even volunteer English football to operate trials. ‘In 20 years we’ll look back and say: “Wasn’t it quaint that we didn’t use video technology?”’ said Dyke. ‘When we discussed it at IFAB, even the ones who were most against it accept it’s going to happen. ‘If we’re going to do it sometime, why don’t we do it now? We are 100 per cent behind it. I suspect we would like to do an experiment, but you’d have to get that throu .

A crystal ball might be more useful for the American star, who has faced plenty of slippery slopes in her dramatic skiing career. The 30-year-old has twice fought back from a career-threatening right knee injury but this season she has been back to her brilliant best. At the final meeting of the ski season in the pretty French resort of Meribel, Vonn raced to more records on the women's World Cup tour -- a seventh downhill season title and her 18th crystal globe overall. The sparkly spheres are handed out to winners of the World Cup individual disciplines. \"This downhill title probably means more to me than the others because I've been through so much,\" Vonn told CNN's Alpine Edge. \"It means everything to me, this is what I've been working so hard for for the last two years. \"This season definitely got off to a better start than I expected and I've had some ups and downs for sure but to come away with a globe after a long season is something that I'm really proud of, so it couldn't be better for me right now, I'm so thrilled.\" Vonn, who credits boyfriend Tiger Woods with inspiring her recovery, fended off the challenge of Austria's Anna Fenninger to claim the downhill crown by 103 points.

The skill is named after Antonin Panenka's penalty at Euro 1976 for Czechoslovakia against Germany but Balde lacked all of the conviction that made Panenka's kick famous. His kick was so feeble and light that the Shakhtar goalkeeper had enough time to dive the wrong way, regain his balance and  claim the ball before it trickled over the line.

Bassett claimed that the Crazy Gang had been misrepresented in a 90 minute BT Sport documentary - which won an award at the Sports Journalists’ Association dinner on Monday - screened late last year. Bassett, who was manager of the Dons between 1981 and 1987 and his former player Downes are working in collaboration on the new book. Wimbledon manager Dave Bassett pictured with his team back in 1985 . John Fashanu (left) and Wally Downes hug Vinnie Jones during a 1986 match with Sheffield Wednesday . The Crazy Gang's crowning glory came when they beat Liverpool to win the FA Cup in 1988 . They started work on the project on Wednesday and the book is expected to be released towards the end of the year. Bassett, who won four promotions with the Dons and took them into the old First Division, is wounded by the portrayal of the Crazy Gang as a team of thugs who would go to any lengths to beat the opposition.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage’ on the part of local leaders. ‘They must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs,’ he added. His warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers, politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly Pakistani men who exploited hundreds of children in Rotherham and Oxford. An inquiry last month said Rotherham councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing ‘community cohesion’. It added: ‘By failing to take action against the Pakistani heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough, the council has inadvertently fuelled the far-Right.’ Last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in Oxford, carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board, said there was ‘no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities’. But the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner accused it of ‘pulling its punches’. Sir Michael’s warning was contained in an Ofsted report that found most local councils charged with looking after children’s safety are failing at the job. Only ten out of 43 inspected over the course of a year were found to give a good standard of care and protection. Criticised: Rotherham's director of children's services between 2008 and 2014 Joyce Thacker (left) and former Rotherham Council leader Roger Stone (right) were both criticised for their inaction over the scandal . Sir Michael said youngsters who go missing from children’s homes while in council care are disproportionately at risk of abuse but social workers in some areas still fail to take notice of them. He added: ‘We found children and young people who had been missing were either not having an interview on their return or having one that was of poor quality. 'There was no clear understanding of why children had gone missing.’", "completion": "response:\n\nSir Michael Wilshaw said ‘political and moral courage’ is needed in future .\nWords came amid row over failure of Oxford and Rotherham social workers .\nCases involved mostly Pakistani gangs exploiting hundreds of children .\nInquiry last month said Rotherham councillors shied away from the issue ."}

Having top-scored in MCC's t20 defeat to Sussex on Friday, Cook could not replicate his form as he was trapped lbw by Ryan Sidebottom, with his side all out for 221 in their first innings. Yorkshire's reply started strongly and they ended day one on 82 for two, with Adam Lyth - the man who could partner Cook on England's tour of the West Indies - hitting an unbeaten half-century. Alastair Cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in Abu Dhabi . Yorkshire's Ryan Sidebottom celebrates after trapping Cook lbw for just three runs . Cook will now be able to see at the closest of quarters whether or not Lyth has what it takes to occupy that spot in the wake of his first call-up earlier this week. Sidebottom removed Nick Compton - someone who has partnered Cook in Tests - with the first ball of the match as the MCC captain edged a delivery into Jonny Bairstow's gloves. Cook soon followed Compton back into the pavilion before Michael Carberry and James Hildreth steadied the ship. James Hildreth scored 89 to help MCC up to a score of 221 in their first innings in Abu Dhabi . Adam Lyth was unbeaten on 53 as Yorkshire closed day one on 82 for two in response . The duo put on 74 for the third wicket before Carberry fell for 36, but Hildreth pushed on and made 89 before Tim Bresnan got him out lbw after lunch. Daryl Mitchell (54) and Zafar Ansari (24) were the only others who could make it into double figures as the final five batsmen could only add five runs between them. Lyth then took centre-stage as he started the Yorkshire reply, although he lost fellow opener and captain Alex Lees as he was caught behind off the bowling of Matt Dunn for 11. The Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi is once again playing host to the floodlight contest . A 72-ball half-century from Lyth kept the reigning champions ticking over until Jack Leaning was caught off Ansari late in the day - with Steven Patterson brought in as night-watchman to see out the closing overs. He will return to the crease with Lyth (53 not out) on Monday with Yorkshire trailing by 139 runs with eight first-innings wickets in hand.", "completion": "response:\n\nEngland Test captain scored just three runs at Sheikh Zayed Stadium .\nNick Compton was dismissed for a duck in champion county match .\nJames Hildreth scored 89 to help MCC post 221 in first innings .\nYorkshire closed day one in Abu Dhabi on 82 for two ."}

And Sportsmail understands Lerner is expected to fly into Birmingham over the coming days for further discussions regarding a sale. Randy Lerner, pictured in 2011, is speaking to a consortium over a proposed £150million sale of Aston Villa . Talks over a takeover are understood to be at an advanced stage and Lerner’s decision to fly into England is viewed as a key step towards the completion of a deal. The consortium is in the due diligence stage of their proposed takeover, though the eventual price of the sale will depend on which league Villa are playing in next season. Christian Benteke is pictured scoring for Aston Villa in their 4-0 thumping of Sunderland last month . Lerner wants to receive his full £150m asking price . Lerner’s expected arrival in the Midlands comes after it emerged Lerner’s Midlands property has been made available as part of the takeover. The farmhouse, located in Bodymoor Heath, is understood to be worth in the region of £3m. Lerner has been keen to sell Villa for some time, a period that has seen the club go through a difficult period on the pitch. The sacking of Paul Lambert and subsequent arrival of Tim Sherwood has helped stimulate the club, as has their pending FA Cup semi-final. But Villa are still in danger of dropping into the second tier of English football for the first time since 1987. Lerner is desperate for the team to avoid that scenario as he looks to receive his full £150m asking price.

It found one in four of those questioned thought she would be the next party leader – whether there is a leadership election later this year in the wake of a Tory election defeat or in six years. Some 26 per cent of those asked backed Mrs May, compared to 22 per cent for Mr Johnson, and 12 per cent for Sajid Javid, rising star of the Tory Right, who is Culture Secretary. The poll will disappoint those Tories who want Chancellor George Osborne to succeed Mr Cameron, who did not register as a potential future leader. Mrs May is seen by allies as Britain’s Angela Merkel and is the longest serving home secretary in more than 50 years. She will challenge Mr Johnson – whom she is thought to regard as a ‘faintly ridiculous figure’ – if the Tories lose the election and Mr Cameron stands down. Mr Johnson is expected to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge, having been selected as the party’s candidate for the election, while continuing in his role as mayor. Future Labour MPs told Populus that Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, was favourite to be the party’s next leader. One in four picked the Merseyside MP and former arch Blairite whose politics have become notably more left wing in recent years. Close behind him was Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna on 22 per cent and Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, on 21 per cent. Populus interviewed 147 MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates between January 20 and February 13, all of whom are expected to win their seats.", "completion": "response:\n\nMay often top of the polls as favourite politician by party member .\n26% backed Mrs May compared to 22% for Mr Johnson .\nSeen by allies as Britain's Angela Merkel - chancellor of Germany .\nShadow health secretary Andy Burnham favourite for next Labour leader ."}

For its final episode Friday night, the show that made it cool to join the high school glee club focused on core characters introduced in the first season. The first hour of Friday's season finale, aptly titled \"2009,\" was a retelling of the first episode, which included a memorable performance of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" by the original members of William McKinley High School's glee club. Instead of telling it again through Finn's perspective, the finale showed what led the other characters to join New Directions, culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring Monteith. The second hour brought us to the present day, with Will passing New Directions on to Sam so he can take charge of McKinley High as a fine arts school.

Mass urbanization is proving to be \"the single most important transformation\" the world is seeing in the 21st century, according to Jamal Saghir, director of sustainable development at the World Bank, and it shows no signs of letting up. By 2050, the U.N. predicts 66% of us will call a city our home. It is generally accepted that cities are the engines of economic growth, and nowhere are these engines firing harder, or populations growing faster, than in the developing world. With burgeoning higher education systems and enviably young workforces, African cities in particular are booming. Commended for their diversity, adaptability and enterprise, investors are taking note. Global auditing firm PwC has now quantified and ranked Africa's urban hubs in a new report listing the continent's top \"Cities of Opportunity.\" With the caveat that only one city per country could be assessed, PwC set out ranking locations in terms of infrastructure, human capital, economics and society and demographics. North African cities dominated the top five, with Cairo claiming pole position, followed by Tunis, Johannesburg, Casablanca and Algiers. Analysts cited the age of North African cities as a determining factor, with strong infrastructure across the board, incubating an environment for human capital to thrive. However, sub-Saharan cities registered among the highest in terms of society and demographics, excelling in diversity and population growth, both useful when looking towards future investment. Indeed, the report also offered an alternative ranking, gauging the strongest trajectories in terms of investment. GDP growth, ease of doing business, attracting FDI, middle class and overall population growth all took precedent. Under these criteria, Cairo could only achieve a mid-table ranking and was the only city in the top 10 north of the Sahara. Dar es Salaam, Lusaka, Nairobi, Lagos and Accra made up the top five, suggesting a new generation of African powerhouse economies is waiting in the wings. That being said, one city's development does not preclude another's. What is certain is that the battle for economic dominance is on. Read this: Africa's 10 most prosperous countries .

Bosses at the Palace Museum in the city have begun a crackdown on the popular phone accessories over fears that one wrong move could cause lasting damage to the invaluable artifacts in the ancient palace houses. The People's Daily Online reports that eagle-eyed staff are keeping watch over photo-enthusiasts in the palace's narrow or crowded areas, as well as all the indoor exhibitions, to avoid any potentially costly accidents. Ban: The Forbidden City has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur . 'Selfie sticks will cause safety concerns, whether for tourists or the exhibits,' Shen Lixia, deputy director of the museum's tourist reception department, told China Daily. 'It may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics.' She added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas, the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all. However, the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the Forbidden City - so tourists can still get the all-important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background.

The glut of top grades at GCSE and A-level is forcing employers to focus on young people’s extra-curricular activities, according to a business leader. John Cridland – director general of the Confederation of British Industry – said his members must consider character-building elements of a candidate’s CV, rather than just qualifications.

Stable condition: Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated . Scientists found animals that were isolated had higher levels of stress hormones and became difficult to manage. The findings, published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour, showed that horses are at their happiest in a paddock. Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated. These stress levels could also lead to sickness and disease, the study published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour found. Research: The study by Nottingham Trent University (above) found that as a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours . Equine welfare expert Kelly Yarnell told the Daily Telegraph: ‘To the human eye, the stable appears safe and inviting and is based on the belief of what the horse finds comfortable. ‘However, for a social animal that spends most of its time in close contact with other horses, the isolation brought about by single housing could activate an equine stress response.’ She said equine welfare would be improved by shared housing. In the wild, horses live in herds that move over up to 30 sq miles while domestic horses often spend most of the day inside. Lee Hackett, director of equine policy at The British Horse Society, said the study should change the way we keep horses. He said: ‘It is fairly obvious that keeping any animal in a domestic setting could potentially compromise it, whether that be a hamster in a cage or a lion in a zoo.'", "completion": "response:\n\nStables prevent horses interacting with their neighbours, scientists say .\nIsolated animals suffer higher stress levels and become harder to manage .\nNottingham Trent University study shows horses are happiest in paddock ."}

A writer and photographer for the magazine accompanied a team of scientists to Honduras' Mosquitia region on the trail of a legendary \"White City\" or \"City of the Monkey God.\" The expedition was launched after aerial light detection scanning  -- known as LIDAR -- uncovered what appeared to be man-made structures below the rainforest, National Geographic said. Seeking to confirm the discovery, a team of U.S. and Honduran archaeologists, a LIDAR engineer, an ethnobotanist, anthropologists and documentary filmmakers entered the remote region. They were protected by Honduran Special forces, the magazine said. Writer Douglas Preston said the team emerged February 25, after documenting the ruins of a \"vanished culture.\" \"In contrast to the nearby Maya, this vanished culture has been scarcely studied and it remains virtually unknown. Archaeologists don't even have a name for it,\" Douglas wrote. Archaeologists no longer believed in the existence of a single \"White City,\" he said, instead believing there had been an entire civilization with many cities. The expedition found earth works, including an earthen pyramid as well as a collection of stone sculptures, thought to potentially have been burial offerings. Archaeologist Oscar Neil Cruz from the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH) estimated they dated from A.D. 1000 to 1400, Douglas wrote. The researchers were greeted by wildlife which appeared never before to have seen humans, wandering unafraid through their camp. \"This is clearly the most undisturbed rain forest in Central America. The importance of this place can't be overestimated,\" ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin told National Geographic. The team left their finds unexcavated and are keeping the exact location of the site secret in an attempt to prevent looting. But in his article, Douglas warned that that the area was nonetheless under threat, with illegal logging for cattle farming within a dozen miles. IHAH director Virgilio Paredes Trapero told National Geographic that the forest and valley could disappear within eight years unless action was taken. \"The Honduran government is committed to protecting this area, but doesn't have the money. We urgently need international support.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nNational Geographic has announced the discovery of a lost city in the remote Honduran rainforest .\nThe magazine says scientists believe the city belonged to a mysterious ancient civilization .\nA team documented the site after aerial light scanning showed man-made structures ."}

The Italian scored for his country against Germany in the semi-final of Euro 2012 in Warsaw, Poland . Perhaps serving as a reminder of what he can do, Balotelli recreated the celebration for Instagram, alongside the message, 'Old euro cup pose LOADING....' In the most recent picture, Balotelli appears to be sporting a new tattoo on his pectoral, as well as a far less zany hairstyle. The Reds forward has struggled for goals of late, only netting four in 25 matches this season. He did, though, get on the scoresheet for Jamie Carragher's XI in last weekend's Liverpool All-Star game. He'll be hoping he can take that form into the Premier League, starting with Arsenal next Saturday.

Mr Xie told the male pupils from Nanguang High School in Fujian to stay behind after class on Thursday because they were being too loud. He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs, People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered. Stronger ethics and appropriate styles of teaching would be implemented at the school, the department added. Mr Liu said that a school representative had already gone to the homes of the two students to apologise formally.

The bizarre video features some bemused locals laughing while recording a four-legged chicken wandering around looking for food. Completely indifferent to the situation, the chicken’s two extra deformed legs trail behind it and drag along the floor as it walks. A woman picks up the chicken and brings it into better view of the camera and the bird seems perplexed by the attention it has gained. The video concludes with a close-up shot of the chicken minding its own business, seemingly content with its additional body parts. Surprisingly, four-legged chickens are not as uncommon as many people would think. The chicken appears completely indifferent to having two extra legs as it wanders around and drags them behind it . The video concludes with the filmmaker going in for a close-up shot of the chicken's extra legs . In 2005, a live chicken was found among 36,000 other birds at a farm in America. Named Henrietta, the bird managed to go unnoticed for 18 months at Brendle Farms in Somerset, Pennsylvania, before it discovered by a foreman. Farmer Mark Brendle's 13-year-old daughter Ashley named the chicken and asked to keep it as a family pet. The bird had two normal front legs but behind those were two more which were dragged behind when Henrietta walked, exactly like the chicken featured in this video. The condition called Polymelia is a birth defect that results in individuals having more limbs, which are usually shrunken or deformed. This can sometimes occur when an embryo begins to develop as conjoined twins.

Nick Clegg yesterday handed over £150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks. The Lib Dem leader’s generosity to the handful of Cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months. Yesterday’s handout brings Coalition spending on attempts to revive Cornish to £500,000 – enough to give nearly £900 to every person who speaks it. The Deputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls. It comes a week after the party announced a drop in fuel prices that mainly benefits areas full of Lib Dem voters. The 5p cut on fuel duty covers 17 rural areas, 14 of which are Lib Dem seats. Three of Cornwall’s six MPs are Lib Dems with slim majorities and Mr Clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the Commons on the day Chancellor George Osborne presented his Autumn Statement in December. Mr Clegg said: ‘I am determined to keep [Cornish] alive and thriving. ‘Great efforts have been made to revive and return Cornish to common use. It would be a crime to let such a distinct language disappear again.’ Cornish has not been widely used since the 18th century. At the 2011 census 557 people listed it as their first language. Last April, Lib Dems persuaded the Council of Europe to recognise Cornish people as a ‘national minority’ in England, which means the Government is now pledged to ‘combat discrimination’ against them. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I don’t know what the Cornish is for a blatant electoral bribe, but with £150,000 of taxpayers’ money I’m sure that Nick Clegg can tell us. It would appear that Mr Clegg is trying to buy votes with public money.’ The money will go to the Cornish Language Partnership, an organisation financed by taxpayers and run by activists and local council nominees. Mr Clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to ‘keep the lights on’.

The dispute between the party’s Election chief Lucy Powell and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton flared up over an invitation to the Brit pop music awards on the night of a crucial Commons vote. Insiders say the row brought simmering tensions between the starkly contrasting pair – both rivals for Miliband’s ear – to a head. Flare-up: Election chief Lucy Powell, 40, left, and Chief Whip Rosie Winterton, 56, became embroiled in a dispute over Ms Powell's Brit Awards plans . It was caused by the desire of 40-year-old Ms Powell – who is tipped as a future Labour leader – to attend the Brits ‘pre-party’ where guests mingle with pop stars. But Ms Winterton, 56, ordered Ms Powell to stay at Westminster for a vote called by Miliband to ban MPs having second jobs. One source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna and Co.’ The argument reportedly intensified when Powell was told she had a special duty to be there because the ‘second jobs’ debate was partly the responsibility of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office team, which includes her. In the end, Ms Powell backed down and took part in the vote. But she still managed to get to the main Brits Awards event at London’s O2 Arena. Yorkshire-born Ms Winterton, who has never married and is renowned for her black leather boots, revels in her role in charge of party discipline. Commenting on the dispute, one source said: ‘Rosie told her she had no right to miss the vote to go hobnobbing with Madonna (pictured falling on stage) and Co’ at the Brits .

Judge Flavio Roberto de Souza was dismissed from the high-profile case of Eike Batista, a former multi-billionaire tycoon who is accused of insider trading. Officials said Mr de Souza was deemed unfit to continue sitting the trial because he was caught driving home in Mr Batista's Porsche Cayenne, estimated to be worth £100,000. Luxury: Judge de Souza was caught behind the wheel of the £100,000 Porsche Cayenne - similar to the one pictured - that he had ordered to be seized from former billionaire Eike Batista . The judge claimed that police had no appropriate place to park the car - which was confiscated after an order that he issued - so he decided it was for the best if he took it home for safe keeping. Mr de Souza's decisions in the case have now been annulled, meaning a retrial is now required. A new judge is now expected to be appointed in the case, which began last November. Mr Batista was once Brazil's richest person, with an estimated £20 billion fortune. He is accused of manipulating market charges in the sales of shares of two of his companies. The 58-year-old made his fortune in mining, oil and gas exploration. He was listed as the seventh wealthiest person in the world as recently as 2012.

Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of an ambitious ‘rewilding’ scheme. Although the animals would be introduced onto privately owned estates, the woodland would be unfenced, meaning the 70lb animals could roam free around the countryside. Lynx could be introduced into the UK countryside for the first time in 1,300 years, it emerged yesterday . Scientists argue that introducing lynx will benefit the ecosystem, by helping control the 1million UK deer population, as well as boosting the tourist economy. But the move is controversial and likely to be opposed by farmers worried about the animals savaging their livestock and game birds. Under the plan, devised by the Lynx Trust, four to six cats would be released at each site. Around the size of a large dog and with powerful claws for climbing, they will be released into areas rich in deer and trees and each will wear a tracking device so their movements can be monitored. Experts want to release lynx, which prey mainly on deer, into woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire as part of a ‘rewilding’ scheme . The Trust said it would be launching a public consultation this week, before applying to the Government via Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) for formal permission. Paul O’Donoghue, a science adviser to the Lynx Trust, said: ‘The lynx is a magical animal that last roamed Great Britain [at least] 1,300 years ago. ‘It is one of the most beautiful cats on the planet and its absence makes Britain a poorer place.’ But a spokesman for the National Farmers’ Union said money could be better spent elsewhere. ‘We would be concerned about the reintroduction due to its high cost and failure risk,’ he said. ‘We believe budgets are better focused on developing existing biodiversity.’ While Ron Macdonald, policy director of SNH, who would have to licence the reintroduction, said they also had concerns. ‘There are pluses and minuses to reintroducing any species,’ he said. ‘Lynx could help reduce deer numbers in Scottish woodlands but some land-use organisations have concerns about the impact of a reintroduction on livestock.’", "completion": "response:\n\nExperts want to release lynx in woodland in Norfolk, Cumbria and Scotland .\nIt would be first time big cats were wild in UK countryside for 1,300 years .\nWoodland would be unfenced, meaning the 70lb animals could roam free .\nThe controversial is move likely to be opposed by Britain's farmers ."}

The problem is, when you’re confined to a little seat on a fighter jet hurtling through the clouds at the speed of sound and the pilot is holding a chocolate bar, just how can you get your hands on it? Well a pilot and his navigator found the perfect way without having to take their eyes off the sky, and captured the moment on camera. The pilots appear to be part of the US Navy, judging by their helmets, but little is known about the origin of the video. The pilot lets go of the chocolate bar to allow the gravitational pull to transport it to his navigator . Holding a Snickers chocolate bar in his hand, the pilot lets go and allows the gravitational force to do the rest. Waiting with an outstretched arm, as the chocolate bar floats behind the pilot, the navigator reaches out and after a little bit of scrabbling manages to catch it in his hands. Throwing it back up in the air before catching it again the navigator waves the bar around in celebration and the pilot gives him the thumbs up in approval. Floating in the air, the chocolate begins its journey towards the navigator who waits with an outstretched hand . On its way: The navigator scrambles for the chocolate bar as it floats towards him and manages to catch it . The fact that it was uploaded to an empty Youtube account however has brought about speculation that the video is a commercial for Snickers. But it may just be a way for the two pilots to keep their identity a mystery while having some fun. Weightlessnes like this occurs when there are no external objects touching the chocolate bar and exerting a push or pull upon it. When in a state of free fall like the pilots, the only force acting upon the snack is gravity – a non-contact force. And since gravity cannot be felt without any other opposing forces, there is no sensation of it present.

Two men from different worlds — a BuzzFeed editor from New York and a man in southern China known as \"Brother Orange\" — have united dramatically after social media helped them bond over a stolen iPhone. Matt Stopera, 27, was greeted with bouquets of flowers, hordes of photographers and screaming fans as he arrived in Meizhou, southern China Wednesday, embracing Li Hongjun --  a restaurant owner who somehow came across the iPhone that Stopera lost in New York over a year ago. Li doesn't speak English and Stopera doesn't speak Chinese — but Chinese social media users are convinced they are soul mates. The star-crossed pair first connected when Stopera noticed strange photos in his iCloud image gallery of a man taking selfies with an orange tree. Confused, Stopera took to the Internet to see if anyone knew who the mysterious man was. The story went viral in China, where Internet users banded together to search for the stranger, who they nicknamed Brother Orange. That man was Li, from Guangdong province, who was snapping pics with Stopera's old iPhone without realizing the photos were being uploaded to the BuzzFeed writer's cloud account. With the mystery solved, thousands of Chinese Internet users demanded a \"happy ending\" and clamored for the two men to meet. Brother Orange made the first move. \"Matt, I welcome you to come to Meizhou and try some local food,\" he said on Weibo, China's microblogging platform. That post was \"liked\" over 12,000 times. Matt quickly accepted.  \"Everybody wants me and Brother Orange to unite,\" he told CNN last month. While Stopera waited for his visa to be approved, the two swapped messages -- Stopera began learning Mandarin phrases, while Brother Orange posted videos of himself learning English. But when they finally met, the smiles and hugs said it all. According to images posted to social media, the two spent their first hours in China eating noodles and walking around tourist sites. They also planted a tree together.

Super agent Jorge Mendes, who includes Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho among his clients, has claimed the ban is illegal and will kill competition in Europe. The Spanish and Portuguese leagues have also opposed the ban. TPO is a practice which takes place in several countries, particularly in South America, where companies own the economic rights of players and benefit from their transfer fees. It has been banned in the Premier League since 2008. UEFA president Michel Platini has defended a ban on third party ownership (TPO) of footballers . Platini, who pushed FIFA to impose the ban - said the ban would stop huge sums of money disappearing from football. Speaking on a UEFA video forum in response to a question from Paris St Germain manager Laurent Blanc, Platini said: 'I have put a lot of pressure on FIFA to stop third party ownership. 'Today, it's shameful to see some players with one of their arms belonging to one person, a leg belonging to a funds pension located who knows where, and a third person owning his foot. 'It is shameful; we're dealing with a type of slavery that belongs to the past. 'Everyone earns money on such transfers, and while we are trying to find money to invest in football, that money goes in the pockets of I don't know who, and I don't know where.

Kia Joorabchian, head of Media Sports Investments, part-owned a number of high-profile players . Platini also said in the forum that the biggest misconception about him was that he alone took major decisions about football. He added: 'I think that the people in Europe, or in the world, they think that I take my decisions alone. But you have to understand one thing, I am very democratic and very transparent, and I never take a decision alone without the support of the executive committee or with the Congress of the UEFA. 'I listen to everybody very carefully and I take my decision, when it is necessary to take a decision, always for the good of the game and for the good of football.

A study found that the more satisfied a person was with their love life in their 60s and 70s, the sharper their mind and the better their memory. One possibility is that an active sex life keeps the brain young. The finding follows a recent British study which revealed that age is no barrier to an active love life. Dutch researchers found that people in their 70s having sex were better able to use their memory, file photo . The Manchester University study found, more than half of men and almost a third of women aged 70-plus are still sexually active. And one third of these have sex at least twice a month. The latest study involved quizzing more than 1,700 Dutch men and women about their sex life and their need for intimacy. The volunteers, who ranged in age from 58 to 98, were also put through a battery of mental tests, designed to assess everything from memory to the ability to think abstractly. Two-thirds of the men and women had a partner and a similar number said that they still felt the need for intimacy. Those who were satisfied with their sex life and said that sexuality was important did better on the tests. The link was particularly strong in women, the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry reports. The researchers, from the Altrecht mental health centre, can’t be sure if staying sexually active was keeping the brain or if interest in sex dwindles as the mind fails. However, previous research has credited having sex with the growth of new brain cells, in rats at least. It has also been suggested that doing a crossword is better for the brain than an orgasm – because it gives the whole brain a workout, rather than just one area of it. Researchers have found that rats can boost their brain power by having more sex than normal . The Dutch researchers said it is important not to assume that sex is just for the young. They wrote: ‘Many beliefs about sexual behaviour in older populations are based on personal and stereotyped views of ageing and sexuality. ‘Older persons are generally expected to no longer be capable of or to be lacking interest in sex when, in reality, many elderly persons require sexuality to be important and wish to remain sexually active as they age. ‘Age itself is no adequate predictor of sexuality; the reality of ageing is that most people continue to have sexual feelings of some sort.’ ends .", "completion": "response:\n\nUniversity researchers found that sex in later life helps boost memory .\nMore than half of men and a third of women over 70 are sexually active .\nOne third of the old people surveyed admitted having sex twice a month .\nDutch researchers quizzed people aged between 58 and 98 .\nThey also subjected them to a battery ."}

Jose Mourinho says Cech can leave Chelsea if he wishes, but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world. The three most expensive goalkeepers so far: Gianluigi Buffon (£32.6m), Manuel Neuer (£19m) and David De Gea (£18m) – although all were 25 or under when they made their move. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has said goalkeeper Petr Cech can leave Stamford Bridge in the summer . David de Gea, Manuel Neuer and Ginaluigi Buffon are the three most expensive goalkeepers in history . Cech cannot command such a fee at his age. A better marker may be the £9m Liverpool paid for Simon Mignolet. Is Cech better than Mignolet? Yes. So if Chelsea asked for £10m for a 33-year-old reserve, should Arsenal be tempted? Yes again. The absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding Arsenal back. Cech could easily last another four years at the top, making him value at £10m. Pat Jennings was 32 when he switched from Tottenham Hotspur to Arsenal in 1977; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39. There has never been a question over his worth and Cech could be as important. Cech is a better goalkeeper than Liverpool stopper Simon Mignolet whom the Reds paid £9million for in 2013 .

A tough start to the season in La Liga that saw Barca fall away from league leaders Real Madrid had Enrique under pressure within weeks of taking the job, but a brilliant turnaround in form seems to have swung things in his favour.

But one couple got more than they bargained for when they came head to head with an American bison - also referred to as a buffalo - while on the road. In the clip the car can be seen waiting in anticipation – indicator sounding – as a herd of three bison come galloping slowly towards it. Getting closer and closer, the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper. Reacting, the filmmaker exclaims: ‘Don’t run into our car,’ just as the bison crashes into it – the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap. Shocked, a lady in the car laughs as the man readjusts the camera and begins filming the two remaining bison, who look quite content standing sideways in the middle of the road. As the bison gets  closer it shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper . Speaking about the incident, the filmmaker said: ‘I thought the bison would simply run by our car at a full clip. 'Instead, at the last minute, the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head-butts our car. There was nothing we could do to avoid being hit.’ He added: 'It was fortunate that the car was turned off, since a head-on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph  would  likely cause the airbags to deploy.' As the filmmaker calls for the bison not to run into the car it continues charging forward and makes contact with it . Readjusting the camera, which was thrown up and then down by the impact, the video maker captures the bison waking away . Yellowstone is the only place in America where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times and as a result the area is home to the nation’s largest bison population on public land. Known for being agile despite their size, as well as aggressive, Bison can charge at up to 35mph. The bison population in Yellowstone is estimated at 4,600 in two breeding herds.

Around 40 per cent of girls said their parents didn't talk to them enough about finances, compared to just 24 per cent of boys. According to the College Board, the average annual cost of tuition and fees for the 2014–2015 school year was as follows: . Furthermore, females - teens and their parents - both have lower expectations about their potential earning power. Moms are significantly more likely than dads to say their child will earn $15k or less at their first job after graduation (26 per cent compared with 17 per cent respectively). Similarly, when asked about their future earning power, 24 per cent of teen girls say they’ll make $15k or less at their first job, compared to only 16 per cent of boys who feel the same. It appears things aren't improving either. The overall number of teens who think their parents don’t spend enough time talking to them about money matters is up by 11 per cent over last year's findings.", "completion": "response:\n\nA new study, conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, revealed a significant disconnect between expectations .\nMore than a third of parents polled admitted they don't talk to their teens about money at all .\nFemales - parents and teens - both have lower expectations about their potential earning power .\nParents are more likely to discuss money matters with sons than daughters ."}

If found guilty, she could face up to 10 years in prison. On her Facebook page, Yingluck said she behaved with integrity and honesty during her time as prime minister. \"I pledge that I have followed correct proceedings of the constitution, laws of the country in every way.\" The rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop.

A 60-year-old man was crushed to death at a machine shop in Ohio where he had worked for 38 years. The victim has been identified locally as longtime employee William Haring.

Images of parents and family members clambering up school buildings and clinging on window ledges to pass cheat sheets to their children have left authorities in despair. The incident took place on Wednesday in the state of Bihar, where students were writing their year-end grade 10 examinations. Examples of cheating incidents are not hard to find in India. But, even compared to previous events, this seems to be unprecedented in its blatancy. Bihar Education Minister PK Shahi told reporters that children won't learn if they're constantly helped by family members. \"Government can only hold fair examinations with the help of the parents, society and the children,\" he said. \"This is a collective responsibility.\" In a developing economy like India, education is a precious commodity. With more than 1.2 billion people, proper schooling could hold the key for much of the population to get out of a vicious cycle of poverty. Earlier this week, a father in the city of Mathura was caught strapping his 8-year old daughter to a motorcycle after she refused to attend school to take her assessment. Tied with a multi-strand rope to the back of a bike, onlookers captured images of the trussed girl, her bare feet hanging low, scraping the asphalt. According to local police officials, the girl's parents offered her several incentives, such as chocolates and toys to entice her, however when the girl was still reluctant, her father decided to take matters in his own hands. After photos started making the rounds on social media, police officials took the man into custody and charged him with \"breach of the peace.\" He is now out on bail. \"Even after he got out, the father showed no remorse. He has five children to feed and he believes the only way they can get out of this poverty trap is through education,\" a senior police official handling the case told CNN. The flaws in India's education system are well-documented. The country has a literacy rate of only 74%, compared to 95% in China. Women suffer particularly badly here; only 64% have formal education. Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide campaign urging parents to send their children, especially daughters, to school and properly educate them. According to the United Nations, India has the largest youth population in the world, with more than a quarter of citizens aged between 10 and 24.", "completion": "response:\n\nImages of parents sneaking their children cheat sheets have dumbfounded many in India .\nEducation remains the way out of poverty for millions of young Indians, but the state is failing many of them .\nSome parents go to desperate lengths to get their children educated ."}

Christie, 54, is the subject of an ITV4 documentary on Tuesday, which offers a rare insight into the psyche of one of Britain’s greatest but most controversial sportsmen. He recalls two alleged racist incidents, the first shortly after he won a gold medal at the European Indoor Championships in 1986. Linford Christie, now an athletics coach, has spoken of allegedly racist treatment at the hands of policeman . ‘I remember when I got my Great Britain tracksuit, I was so proud,’ he said. ‘I walked along Shepherd’s Bush, this policeman started saying, “What’s a n***** like you doing in a British tracksuit?” 'I went into a chip shop and came out of the shop, and he jumped me, twisted my arm behind my back, and arrested me. The next day they dropped all charges. It was just so stupid.’ Another time, he said, police refused to believe he was the owner of a sponsored car and arrested him. Christie claims to have been arrested by a 'racist' policeman after winning the European Indoors in 1986 . ‘A couple of days later the police dropped a letter which said, “You don’t need to come back any more, we’ve made our enquiries”. ‘I said, “I still want an apology”, and they totally refused.’ Christie threatened court proceedings and the police eventually apologised.

Officers on patrol in the Deansgate area of the city noticed the man with the powerful cutting tool at 11.45pm on Monday. The blue BMW 3-series was immobilised by the DVLA because it was understood to be untaxed. Police spoke with a motorist they observed standing near his clamped car with a petrol-powered saw . The BMW 3 series was immobilised with a clamp by the DVLA in Deansgate, Manchester City Centre . According to Greater Manchester Police no arrests were made at the scene because officers intervened before any damage was inflicted on the clamp. It is understood that the motorist had a two-stroke petrol-powered Stihl saw with a metal cutting disc. The DVLA has the power to immediately clamp or impound any car if it is not properly taxed. Car owners can notify authorities if they are not using the car and sign statutory declaration that the car is off the road. However, if they sign the declaration and continue to use the car, it can be seized. Motorists who have been clamped by the DVLA have to provide evidence that they have taxed their car before it can be released. If a car has not been taxed, the motorist will have to pay a 'surety' deposit of £700 to have it released. According to the DVLA the cost of having a clamp removed increases the longer the car is immobilised. If a driver refuses to pay, the DVLA will destroy or sell the car to recoup some of the costs.

She accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at Delaware's Dover International Speedway in September. Twice, the NASCAR 2004 Cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times. That meant he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as two subsequent Sprint Cup races. But he should be able to compete through the fall, and NASCAR says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events. The case against Busch took a significant turn last week, when the Delaware Department of Justice announced that charges would not be filed against him. \"As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse,\" Busch said then. \"I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" A Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February that Busch must stay away from Driscoll for a year. NASCAR officials decided to lift Busch's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit's reinstatement program, completed behavioral assessments and got the OK from a behavioral health care expert to race again. He's not totally out of the woods. In a news release, NASCAR said Busch must \"undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized.\" Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, said the lack of charges against Busch expedited his return. \"We have made it very clear to Kurt Busch our expectations for him moving forward, which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements as a result of his off-track behavior,\" O'Donnell said.

Van der Garde won the challenge to get a spot in Sunday's race with Swiss F1 team Sauber, who removed him as a driver late last year despite having a contract. Justice Clyde Croft in the Supreme Court of Victoria said Van der Garde's application was successful. Giedo van der Garde, pictured at testing in 2014 was the reserve driver for Sauber last season . Lawyers for Sauber argued Van der Garde was an unacceptable risk because he wasn't trained in the team's car and he did not have a custom seat, but van der Garde's lawyer Tom Clarke said his client was ready to work with the team to get a seat fitted before racing begins. Sauber said in a statement 'the outcome is unfortunately not as expected.' 'We are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season,' Sauber team chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn said. 'What we cannot do is jeopardize the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers.' But Van der Garde said outside court he was ready to race. Practice begins Friday. 'I'm very fit and very strong. I'm looking forward to going back to the team, work hard and do our best for the weekend,' he said. 'I'm the fittest ever. I've been training the last three months flat out.' Van der Garde also said that despite the legal battle, he was keen to work with Sauber again. Dutch driver  claimed he was offered a race seat for the 2015 campaign but Sauber reneged on deal . 'I'm looking forward to going back to the team. I had a very good relationship, I still have a very good relationship, with the team,' he said. One of Sauber's current drivers, Marcus Ericsson or Felipe Nasr, would have to miss out for Van der Garde to race in one of the two team cars.

It is a feat that not even McIlroy mastered with Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Robert Gamez the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years.

He first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff, which he duly holed. It was a putt of similar length that ensured a second Tour win to add to his John Deere Classic success in July 2013, which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest PGA Tour winner for 82 years at the time.", "completion": "response:\n\nJordan Spieth only the fourth player since 1940 to seal two PGA Tour wins under age of 22 .\nGolfing's newest star sets his sights on usurping Rory McIlroy as the world's No.1 .\nConfidence is high going into the Masters, in which he finished second a year ago ."}

Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease. Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system. Valentina's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal. Valentina's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant, according to her father, Freddy Maureira. The teen recently posted a video on her Facebook page, asking Bachelet to allow her to end her life. \"I am tired of living with this sickness,\" Valentina says in the video. \"Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever.\" Bachelet visited Valentina on Saturday for more than an hour at the hospital. The country's minister of health also attended. During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. The teen thanked Bachelet for the visit, and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter, according to CNN Chile. Before the visit, the President had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl. Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said. \"But what are we doing?\" Elizaldo said last week. \"The health ministry is in constant contact with Valentina's family, and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions.\" Valentina's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media. People took to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the debate on assisted suicide. One Twitter user posed the question in a tweet: \"After the case of Valentina Maureira, should euthanasia be legal?\" Doctor Andres Castillo, chief of pediatrics at Catholic University's Clinic Hospital, said that at the moment, Valentina's condition is stable.\" After her diagnosis, doctors expected her to live to about 17, which would give her three and a half more years to live.", "completion": "response:\n\n14-year-old Valentina Maureira suffers from cystic fibrosis .\nIn a video, she asks the President to allow her to have an assisted suicide ."}

Louis van Gaal has revealed that the Man United team chef has been helping his side prepare for their Premier League clash against Liverpool . The occasion is set to be even more highly-charged than usual with both teams competing for a Champions League place and just two points separating them in the Premier League table. Van Gaal said: ‘I have always my assistant manager to say that to me. And he said that also to the players in his presentation of the analysis of Liverpool but I also have the cook, Mike, and he is saying that every day to the players and to me. ‘I like that because that shows that it is a very particular match especially for the fans of Manchester United and it helps also to focus and concentrate on this match.

He hinted that he has deliberately been winding them up in training to test their temperaments. ‘I am the referee in the games that we have had on the training pitch and I have whistled in the way that they have to control their aggression, for example,’ he added. ‘To prepare them already the atmosphere. And I have mentioned that to them after lunch.

Last year the Detroit Lions linebacker hiked in Macchu Picchu for five days, swam with sharks in South Africa and boarded down - and crashed on - an active Nicaraguan volcano. But the 28-year-old hit new heights in a biplane, leaving the cockpit to clamber along the aircraft before the pilot spins the plane 180 degrees at approximately 3,500 feet. Levy was one of the success stories of last season and contributed to the Lions' fearsome defense . Not satisifed with that, the daredevil displayed pictures on his Instagram account of him sat on top of the plane in a harness. Levy has documented his adventurous experiences on Instagram, saying: 'Not ready for the offseason yet, but last year's included riding horses in exotic locales, hiking and sleeping atop a dark cold mountain for two nights, volcanic craters, sledding down an active volcano, cockfights, and saving a woman from a rushing river,'  three months ago. And the thrill-seeker can now add walking in the Troposphere to his antics.

The England striker was surplus to requirements at Louis van Gaal's United, but was quick to capitalize on a mistake by Antonio Valencia to grab the winner just after the hour mark. A disappointing night for United was compounded by a late red card for Argentina international Angel Di Maria, who was given his marching orders after manhandling referee Michael Oliver. Di Maria was initially booked for simulation and took his protests too far by grabbing the official, which led to his instant dismissal. With 10 men, United was never able to exert any real pressure on Arsenal and it took two fine saves David De Gea to deny further goals from Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez for the away side. Victory for Arsenal booked a return to Wembley for a last four clash with either Reading or Bradford City, who are replaying their quarterfinal tie next Monday. Liverpool or Blackburn Rovers will play Aston Villa in the other semifinal. Arsenal had taken a 25th minute lead through Nacho Monreal, the Spanish defender converting after fine move which involved Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But the advantage was short lived with Di Maria finding Wayne Rooney to score with a diving header. United looked to press ahead for the winner, but home hopes were dashed when Valencia made a hash of a back pass and Welbeck was quick to latch on to the loose ball and beat De Gea. 'I believe it was justice for him to score he worked extremely hard today,' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said of Welbeck. His counterpart van Gaal will now, barring a miracle, be left without a trophy in his first season in charge of the English powerhouses, with the pressure now on to seal a top four place in the EPL to guarantee Champions League football next season.", "completion": "response:\n\nArsenal beats Man Utd 2-1 in FA Cup quarterfinal .\nFormer Manchester United player Danny Welbeck scores winner .\nHolders Arsenal took the lead through Nacho Monreal before Wayne Rooney equalized .\nAngel Di Maria sent off for shoving referee in second half ."}
